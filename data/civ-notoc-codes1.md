###### 8051.



The Legislature hereby finds and declares as follows:

(a) Community-based punishment programs require a partnership between the state and local government to provide and expand the use of intermediate sanctions for specifically targeted offender populations.

(b) Community-based programs must operate to punish offenders while at the same time providing opportunities to change behavior.

(c) Community-based punishment programs provide appropriate means of managing select offenders but should not be viewed as the only solution to prison overcrowding.

(d) Community-based punishment programs target prison-bound and jail-bound nonviolent offenders because this group poses the least risk to the public and is the most amenable to the individualized programming and services offered by community-based programs.

(e) Community-based punishment programs emphasize reducing local jail populations, thereby making jail space available for new commitments, parole violators, and probation violators who are now being sent to jail and nonviolent felons who have already been sent to prison for short periods of time.

(f) Community-based punishment programs must be financed from a consistent, reliable, and separate funding source.

(g) Community-based punishment programs should be expanded incrementally with a variety of pilot approaches tested to determine their effectiveness prior to expansion.

(h) In order to effectively utilize available resources, to ensure appropriate management of the local offender population, each county utilizing community-based punishment programs must implement a locally coordinated planning process.

(i) Since successful community-based punishment programs are dependent on the coordinated efforts of, and successful working relationships between, state and local agencies, the Board of Corrections is the logical state agency to coordinate community punishment efforts because of its extensive experience with collaborative state and local programs.

###### 11105.3.



(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a human resource agency or an employer may request from the Department of Justice records of all convictions or any arrest pending adjudication involving the offenses specified in subdivision (a) of Section 15660 of the Welfare and Institutions Code of a person who applies for a license, employment, or volunteer position, in which they would have supervisory or disciplinary power over a minor or any person under their care. The department shall furnish the information to the requesting employer and shall also send a copy of the information to the applicant.

(b) (1) A request for records under subdivision (a) shall include the applicant’s fingerprints, which may be taken by the requester, and any other data specified by the department. The department shall not require the applicant’s residence address for any request for records pursuant to subdivision (a). The request shall be on a form approved by the department, and the department may charge a fee to be paid by the employer, human resource agency, or applicant for the actual cost of processing the request. However, a fee shall not be charged to a nonprofit organization. Requests received by the department for federal level criminal offender record information shall be forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation by the department to be searched for any record of arrests or convictions.

(2) The following procedures are established under this section:

(A) The department, upon receipt of a background check report lacking disposition data, shall conduct research in whatever recordkeeping systems are available in order to obtain complete data.

(B) A human resource agency or employer shall register with the department before submitting a request for screening under this section. Each such request shall be voluntary. As a part of the registration, the human resource agency or employer shall agree to comply with state and federal law and shall so indicate by signing an agreement approved by the department. The department may periodically audit human resource agencies and employers to ensure compliance with federal law and this section.

(C) The human resource agency or employer shall maintain a waiver signed annually by the applicant, employee, or volunteer allowing the release of the state and federal level criminal history information to the human resource agency or employer.

(D) The federal level criminal history information is available to human resource agencies and employers to use only for the purpose of screening employees and volunteers or persons applying to be an employee or volunteer with a human resource agency or employer. The department shall provide this federal criminal history record information directly to the human resource agency or employer as authorized by the written waiver required pursuant to subparagraph (C) for submission of a request to the department.

(E) The determination of whether the criminal history record shows that the applicant, employee, or volunteer has been convicted of, or is under pending indictment for, any crime that bears upon the fitness of the applicant, employee, or volunteer to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children, the elderly, the handicapped, or the mentally impaired shall solely be made by the human resource agency or employer. This section does not require the department to make such a determination on behalf of any human resource agency or employer.

(F) The human resource agency or employer shall notify the person in writing of their right to obtain a copy of any background screening report, including the criminal history records, if any, contained in the report, to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any information contained in any such report, and to obtain a determination as to the validity of such challenge before a final determination regarding the person is made by the human resource agency or employer reviewing the criminal history information.

(c) (1) When a request pursuant to this section reveals that a prospective employee or volunteer has been convicted of a violation or attempted violation of Section 220, 261.5, 273a, 273d, or 273.5, former Section 262, or any sex offense listed in Section 290, except for the offense specified in subdivision (d) of Section 243.4, and where the agency or employer hires the prospective employee or volunteer, the agency or employer shall notify the parents or guardians of any minor who will be supervised or disciplined by the employee or volunteer. A conviction for a violation or attempted violation of an offense committed outside the State of California shall be included in this notice if the offense would have been a crime specified in this subdivision if committed in California. The notice shall be given to the parents or guardians with whom the child resides, and shall be given at least 10 days prior to the day that the employee or volunteer begins their duties or tasks. Notwithstanding any other law, a person who conveys or receives information in good faith and in conformity with this section is exempt from prosecution under Section 11142 or 11143 for conveying or receiving that information. Notwithstanding subdivision (d), the notification requirements of this subdivision shall apply as an additional requirement of any other law requiring criminal record access or dissemination of criminal history information.

(2) The notification requirement pursuant to paragraph (1) shall not apply to a misdemeanor conviction. This paragraph does not preclude an employer from requesting records of misdemeanor convictions from the Department of Justice pursuant to this section.

(d) This section does not supersede any law requiring criminal record access or dissemination of criminal history information. In any conflict with another statute, dissemination of criminal history information shall be pursuant to the mandatory statute. This subdivision applies to, but is not limited to, requirements pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 1500) of Chapter 3 of, and Chapter 3.2 (commencing with Section 1569) and Chapter 3.4 (commencing with Section 1596.70) of, Division 2 of, and Section 1522 of, the Health and Safety Code, and Sections 8712, 8811, and 8908 of the Family Code, and Section 16519.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.

The department shall terminate the service for the individual upon receipt of the notification.

(2) A youth organization that requests subsequent arrest notification service shall, not less than every six months, verify that each individual for whom the service has not been terminated, is still in a position with the youth organization for which the service is permitted.

(c) Any criminal history information obtained pursuant to this section shall be subject to the same requirements and conditions that the information is subject to when obtained by a human resource agency or a bank.

(d) The Legislature finds that contract security organizations and private security organizations often provide security service for financial institutions and human resource agencies, and, consequently, they have the same need for criminal history information as do those entities. Therefore, the Legislature intends to provide authority for contract security organizations and proprietary security organizations to obtain criminal history information to the extent that financial institutions and human resource agencies have that authority concerning their own employees.

(e) As used in this section, “contract security organization” means a person, business, or organization licensed to provide services as a private patrol operator, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 7582.1 of the Business and Professions Code.

###### 11105.7.



(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when a person is required to submit fingerprints or a fingerprint card to the Department of Justice for a criminal background investigation for purposes of employment, certification, or licensing, and the department determines either that it is impossible for the person to submit fingerprints or that the submitted fingerprints are not legible for identification purposes, the department, in its discretion, shall do either of the following:

(1) Make a determination that the person presently is unable to provide legible fingerprints, and therefore shall be deemed to have complied with the statutory requirement to submit fingerprints. The department, using available personal identifying data that the department deems appropriate, shall then conduct a search to determine if the person has a criminal history.

(2) Request that the person submit a second set of fingerprints or obtain verification from another law enforcement agency that he or she is unable to provide legible fingerprint impressions either manually or electronically. If the department requests law enforcement verification of the quality of fingerprints that the person is able to provide, it may designate the law enforcement agency that is to provide the verification and provide a form for the verification. If the second set of fingerprints is illegible or if the designated law enforcement agency verifies that the person is unable to submit legible fingerprints, the person shall be deemed to have complied with the statutory requirement to submit fingerprints, and the department, using available personal identifying data it deems appropriate, shall conduct a search to determine if the person has a criminal history.

(b) After a search of its data bases pursuant to subdivision (a), the department shall issue a certificate regarding the criminal history of the applicant to the employing, licensing, or certifying agency.

(a) (1) If, in the course of performing a criminal history background investigation for an agency or entity statutorily authorized to receive a criminal history, the Department of Justice determines that it appears that the applicant has criminal history record information that the requesting agency is statutorily authorized to receive, but the identity of the applicant cannot be verified with fingerprints, the department shall provide a copy of the criminal history record to the requesting agency or entity but shall note any entries as to which the identity of the subject has not been fingerprint verified.

(2) The department shall compare all available identifying characteristics of the applicant with those that appear in the criminal history information before responding to the requesting agency or entity with conviction disposition information that has not been fingerprint verified.

(b) If an agency or entity denies a license, certificate, or employment based upon information received from the department that is not fingerprint verified, the agency or entity shall notify the applicant of its decision and that he or she may challenge the identification. In that case, the applicant may appeal the decision of the agency or entity on the grounds that the applicant is not the person so identified.

(c) Neither the department nor any of its employees or any requesting agency or entity shall be liable to any applicant for misidentifications made pursuant to this section.

###### 11161.2.



(a) The Legislature finds and declares that adequate protection of victims of domestic violence and elder and dependent adult abuse has been hampered by lack of consistent and comprehensive medical examinations. Medical evidentiary examinations, offered to victims free of charge, and enhanced examination procedures, documentation, and evidence collection will improve patient outcomes, investigation, and prosecution efforts.

(b) The Office of Emergency Services shall, in cooperation with the State Department of Public Health, the Department of Aging and the ombudsman program, the State Department of Social Services, law enforcement agencies, the Department of Justice, the California Association of Crime Lab Directors, the California District Attorneys Association, the California State Sheriffs’ Association, the California Medical Association, the California Police Chiefs’ Association, domestic violence advocates, the California Clinical Forensic Medical Training Center, the California Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner Association, Adult Protective Services, and other appropriate experts:

(1) Establish medical forensic forms, instructions, and examination protocol for victims of domestic violence and elder and dependent adult abuse and neglect, including strangulation, using as a model the form and guidelines developed pursuant to Section 13823.5. The form should include, but not be limited to, a place for a notation concerning each of the following:

(A) Notification of injuries and a report of suspected domestic violence or elder or dependent adult abuse and neglect to law enforcement authorities, Adult Protective Services, or the State Long-Term Care Ombudsmen, in accordance with existing reporting procedures.

(B) Obtaining consent for the forensic medical examination, treatment of injuries, collection of evidence, and written and photographic documentation of injuries. A victim shall be informed that they may refuse to consent to and may withdraw consent for an examination for evidence of domestic violence and elder and dependent adult abuse and neglect, including the collection of physical evidence, but that refusal is not a ground for denial of treatment of injuries and disease, if the person wishes to obtain treatment and consents thereto.

(C) Taking a patient’s history of domestic violence or elder or dependent adult abuse and neglect, including any current or past strangulation history, and other relevant medical history.

(D) Performance of the physical examination for evidence of domestic violence or elder or dependent adult abuse and neglect.

(E) Collection of physical evidence of domestic violence or elder or dependent adult abuse.

(F) Collection of other medical and forensic specimens, as indicated.

(G) Procedures for the collection and preservation of evidence, and submission to a local crime laboratory when appropriate.

(H) Complete documentation of medical forensic exam findings.

(I) When strangulation is suspected, documentation may be included on a supplemental strangulation form as part of the medical evidentiary exam.

(2) The forms shall be made accessible for use in an electronic format.

(3) The forms shall become part of the patient’s medical record.

(c) When strangulation is suspected, additional diagnostic testing may be necessary to prevent adverse health outcomes or morbidity.

(d) Victims receiving forensic medical exams for domestic violence have the right to a qualified social worker, victim advocate, or a support person of the victim’s choosing to be present during the examination, when available.

(e) (1) A hospital, clinic, or other emergency medical facility where medical evidentiary examinations are conducted shall develop and implement written policies and procedures for maintaining the confidentiality of medical evidentiary examination reports, including proper preservation and disposition of the reports if the examination program ceases operation, in order to prevent destruction of the medical evidentiary examination reports.

(2) On or before July 1, 2023, a hospital, clinic, or other emergency medical facility at which medical evidentiary examinations are conducted shall implement a system to maintain medical evidentiary examination reports in a manner that facilitates release of the reports as required or authorized by law.

(3) This subdivision does not require a hospital, clinic, or other emergency medical facility to review a patient’s medical records before January 1, 2023, in order to separate medical evidentiary examination reports from the rest of the patient’s medical records.

(f) The costs associated with the medical evidentiary examination of a domestic violence victim shall be separate from diagnostic treatment and procedure costs associated with medical treatment. Costs for the medical evidentiary portion of the examination shall not be charged directly or indirectly to the victim of the assault.

(g) Each county’s board of supervisors shall authorize a designee to approve the Sexual Assault Response Teams (SART), Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner (SAFE) teams, or other qualified medical evidentiary examiners to receive reimbursement through the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) for the performance of medical evidentiary examinations for victims of domestic violence and shall notify Cal OES of this designation. The costs associated with these medical evidentiary exams shall be funded by the state, subject to appropriation by the Legislature. Each county’s designated SART, SAFE, or other qualified medical evidentiary examiners shall submit invoices to Cal OES, who shall administer the program. A flat reimbursement rate shall be established. Within one year upon initial appropriation, Cal OES shall establish a 60-day reimbursement process. Cal OES shall assess and determine a fair and reasonable reimbursement rate to be reviewed every five years.

(h) Reimbursement shall not be subject to reduced reimbursement rates based on patient history or other reasons. Victims of domestic violence may receive a medical evidentiary exam outside of the jurisdiction where the crime occurred and that county’s approved SART, SAFE teams, or qualified medical evidentiary examiners shall be reimbursed for the performance of these exams.

The protocols are intended to assure the competent review of, and that relevant investigation procedures are followed for, the suspected undertreatment, undermedication, overtreatment, and overmedication of pain cases. Consideration shall be made for the special circumstances of urban and rural communities. The investigation protocol shall be designed to facilitate communication between the medical and law enforcement communities and the timely return of medical records pertaining to the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of any patient that are seized by law enforcement from a physician who is suspected of engaging in or having engaged in criminal activity related to the documents.

(b) The costs incurred by the California District Attorneys Association in implementing this section shall be solicited and funded from nongovernmental entities.

(a) The Legislature finds and declares that even though the Legislature has provided for immunity from liability, pursuant to Section 11161.9, for persons required or authorized to report pursuant to this article, that immunity does not eliminate the possibility that actions may be brought against those persons based upon required reports of abuse pursuant to other laws.

In order to further limit the financial hardship that those persons may incur as a result of fulfilling their legal responsibility, it is necessary that they not be unfairly burdened by legal fees incurred in defending those actions.

(b) (1) Therefore, a health practitioner may present a claim to the Department of General Services for reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in any action against that person on the basis of that person reporting in accordance with this article if the court dismisses the action upon a demurrer or motion for summary judgment made by that person or if that person prevails in the action.

###### 11165.15.



For the purposes of this article, the fact that a child is homeless or is classified as an unaccompanied youth, as defined in Section 11434a of the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 11301 et seq.), is not, in and of itself, a sufficient basis for reporting child abuse or neglect. This section shall not limit a mandated reporter, as defined in Section 11165.7, from making a report pursuant to Section 11166 whenever the mandated reporter has knowledge of or observes an unaccompanied minor whom the mandated reporter knows or reasonably suspects to be the victim of abuse or neglect.

_(Amended by Stats. 2014, Ch. 71, Sec. 132. (SB 1304) Effective January 1, 2015.)_

###### 11166.



(a) Except as provided in subdivision (d), and in Section 11166.05, a mandated reporter shall make a report to an agency specified in Section 11165.9 whenever the mandated reporter, in the mandated reporter’s professional capacity or within the scope of the mandated reporter’s employment, has knowledge of or observes a child whom the mandated reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse or neglect. The mandated reporter shall make an initial report by telephone to the agency immediately or as soon as is practicably possible, and shall prepare and send, fax, or electronically transmit a written followup report within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the incident. The mandated reporter may include with the report any nonprivileged documentary evidence the mandated reporter possesses relating to the incident.

(1) For purposes of this article, “reasonable suspicion” means that it is objectively reasonable for a person to entertain a suspicion, based upon facts that could cause a reasonable person in a like position, drawing, when appropriate, on the person’s training and experience, to suspect child abuse or neglect. “Reasonable suspicion” does not require certainty that child abuse or neglect has occurred nor does it require a specific medical indication of child abuse or neglect; any “reasonable suspicion” is sufficient. For purposes of this article, the pregnancy of a minor does not, in and of itself, constitute a basis for a reasonable suspicion of sexual abuse.

(2) The agency shall be notified, and a report shall be prepared and sent by fax or electronic transmission, even if the child has expired, regardless of whether or not the possible abuse was a factor contributing to the death, and even if suspected child abuse was discovered during an autopsy.

(3) A report made by a mandated reporter pursuant to this section shall be known as a mandated report.

(b) If, after reasonable efforts, a mandated reporter is unable to submit an initial report by telephone, the mandated reporter shall immediately or as soon as is practicably possible, by fax or electronic transmission, make a one-time automated written report on the form prescribed by the Department of Justice, and shall also be available to respond to a telephone followup call by the agency with which the mandated reporter filed the report. A mandated reporter who files a one-time automated written report because the mandated reporter was unable to submit an initial report by telephone is not required to submit a written followup report.

(1) The one-time automated written report form prescribed by the Department of Justice shall be clearly identifiable so that it is not mistaken for a standard written followup report. In addition, the automated one-time report shall contain a section that allows the mandated reporter to state the reason the initial telephone call was not able to be completed. The reason for the submission of the one-time automated written report in lieu of the procedure prescribed in subdivision (a) shall be captured in the statewide child welfare information system. The department shall work with stakeholders to modify reporting forms and the statewide child welfare information system as is necessary to accommodate the changes enacted by these provisions.

(2) This subdivision shall not become operative until the statewide child welfare information system is updated to capture the information prescribed in this subdivision.

(3) This subdivision shall become inoperative three years after this subdivision becomes operative or on January 1, 2009, whichever occurs first.

(4) This section does not supersede the requirement that a mandated reporter first attempt to make a report via telephone, or that agencies specified in Section 11165.9 accept reports from mandated reporters and other persons as required.

(c) A mandated reporter who fails to report an incident of known or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect as required by this section is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months confinement in a county jail or by a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or by both that imprisonment and fine. If a mandated reporter intentionally conceals the mandated reporter’s failure to report an incident known by the mandated reporter to be abuse or severe neglect under this section, the failure to report is a continuing offense until an agency specified in Section 11165.9 discovers the offense.

(d) (1) A clergy member who acquires knowledge or a reasonable suspicion of child abuse or neglect during a penitential communication is not subject to subdivision (a). For the purposes of this subdivision, “penitential communication” means a communication, intended to be in confidence, including, but not limited to, a sacramental confession, made to a clergy member who, in the course of the discipline or practice of the clergy member’s church, denomination, or organization, is authorized or accustomed to hear those communications, and under the discipline, tenets, customs, or practices of the clergy member’s church, denomination, or organization, has a duty to keep those communications secret.

(2) This subdivision does not modify or limit a clergy member’s duty to report known or suspected child abuse or neglect when the clergy member is acting in some other capacity that would otherwise make the clergy member a mandated reporter.

(3) (A) On or before January 1, 2004, a clergy member or any custodian of records for the clergy member may report to an agency specified in Section 11165.9 that the clergy member or any custodian of records for the clergy member, prior to January 1, 1997, in the clergy member’s professional capacity or within the scope of the clergy member’s employment, other than during a penitential communication, acquired knowledge or had a reasonable suspicion that a child had been the victim of sexual abuse and that the clergy member or any custodian of records for the clergy member did not previously report the abuse to an agency specified in Section 11165.9. The provisions of Section 11172 shall apply to all reports made pursuant to this paragraph.

(B) This paragraph shall apply even if the victim of the known or suspected abuse has reached the age of majority by the time the required report is made.

(C) The local law enforcement agency shall have jurisdiction to investigate any report of child abuse made pursuant to this paragraph even if the report is made after the victim has reached the age of majority.

(e) (1) A commercial film, photographic print, or image processor who has knowledge of or observes, within the scope of that person’s professional capacity or employment, any film, photograph, videotape, negative, slide, or any representation of information, data, or an image, including, but not limited to, any film, filmstrip, photograph, negative, slide, photocopy, videotape, video laser disc, computer hardware, computer software, computer floppy disk, data storage medium, CD-ROM, computer-generated equipment, or computer-generated image depicting a child under 16 years of age engaged in an act of sexual conduct, shall, immediately or as soon as practicably possible, telephonically report the instance of reasonably suspected abuse to the law enforcement agency located in the county in which the images are seen. Within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the incident, the reporter shall prepare and send, fax, or electronically transmit a written followup report of the incident with a copy of the image or material attached.

(2) A commercial computer technician who has knowledge of or observes, within the scope of the technician’s professional capacity or employment, any representation of information, data, or an image, including, but not limited to, any computer hardware, computer software, computer file, computer floppy disk, data storage medium, CD-ROM, computer-generated equipment, or computer-generated image that is retrievable in perceivable form and that is intentionally saved, transmitted, or organized on an electronic medium, depicting a child under 16 years of age engaged in an act of sexual conduct, shall immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, telephonically report the instance of reasonably suspected abuse to the law enforcement agency located in the county in which the images or materials are seen. As soon as practicably possible after receiving the information concerning the incident, the reporter shall prepare and send, fax, or electronically transmit a written followup report of the incident with a brief description of the images or materials.

(3) For purposes of this article, “commercial computer technician” includes an employee designated by an employer to receive reports pursuant to an established reporting process authorized by subparagraph (B) of paragraph (43) of subdivision (a) of Section 11165.7.

(4) As used in this subdivision, “electronic medium” includes, but is not limited to, a recording, CD-ROM, magnetic disk memory, magnetic tape memory, CD, DVD, thumbdrive, or any other computer hardware or media.

(5) As used in this subdivision, “sexual conduct” means any of the following:

(A) Sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex or between humans and animals.

(B) Penetration of the vagina or rectum by any object.

(C) Masturbation for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer.

(D) Sadomasochistic abuse for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer.

(E) Exhibition of the genitals, pubic, or rectal areas of a person for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer.

(f) Any mandated reporter who knows or reasonably suspects that the home or institution in which a child resides is unsuitable for the child because of abuse or neglect of the child shall bring the condition to the attention of the agency to which, and at the same time as, the mandated reporter makes a report of the abuse or neglect pursuant to subdivision (a).

(g) Any other person who has knowledge of or observes a child whom the person knows or reasonably suspects has been a victim of child abuse or neglect may report the known or suspected instance of child abuse or neglect to an agency specified in Section 11165.9. For purposes of this section, “any other person” includes a mandated reporter who acts in the person’s private capacity and not in the person’s professional capacity or within the scope of the person’s employment.

(h) When two or more persons, who are required to report, jointly have knowledge of a known or reasonably suspected instance of child abuse or neglect, and when there is agreement among them, the telephone report may be made by a member of the team selected by mutual agreement and a single report may be made and signed by the selected member of the reporting team. Any member who has knowledge that the member designated to report has failed to do so shall thereafter make the report.

(i) (1) The reporting duties under this section are individual, and no supervisor or administrator may impede or inhibit the reporting duties, and no person making a report shall be subject to any sanction for making the report. However, internal procedures to facilitate reporting and apprise supervisors and administrators of reports may be established provided that they are not inconsistent with this article. An internal policy shall not direct an employee to allow the employee’s supervisor to file or process a mandated report under any circumstances.

(2) The internal procedures shall not require any employee required to make reports pursuant to this article to disclose the employee’s identity to the employer.

(3) Reporting the information regarding knowledge of or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect to an employer, supervisor, school principal, school counselor, coworker, or other person shall not be a substitute for making a mandated report to an agency specified in Section 11165.9.

(j) (1) A county probation or welfare department shall immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, report by telephone, fax, or electronic transmission to the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the case, to the agency given the responsibility for investigation of cases under Section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and to the district attorney’s office every known or reasonably suspected instance of child abuse or neglect, as defined in Section 11165.6, except acts or omissions coming within subdivision (b) of Section 11165.2, or reports made pursuant to Section 11165.13 based on risk to a child that relates solely to the inability of the parent to provide the child with regular care due to the parent’s substance abuse, which shall be reported only to the county welfare or probation department. A county probation or welfare department also shall send by fax or electronic transmission a written report thereof within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the incident to any agency to which it makes a telephone report under this subdivision.

(2) A county probation or welfare department shall immediately, and in no case in more than 24 hours, report to the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the case after receiving information that a child or youth who is receiving child welfare services has been identified as the victim of commercial sexual exploitation, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 11165.1.

(3) When a child or youth who is receiving child welfare services and who is reasonably believed to be the victim of, or is at risk of being the victim of, commercial sexual exploitation, as defined in Section 11165.1, is missing or has been abducted, the county probation or welfare department shall immediately, or in no case later than 24 hours from receipt of the information, report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement authority for entry into the National Crime Information Center database of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

(k) A law enforcement agency shall immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, report by telephone, fax, or electronic transmission to the agency given responsibility for investigation of cases under Section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code and to the district attorney’s office every known or reasonably suspected instance of child abuse or neglect reported to it, except acts or omissions coming within subdivision (b) of Section 11165.2, which shall be reported only to the county welfare or probation department. A law enforcement agency shall report to the county welfare or probation department every known or reasonably suspected instance of child abuse or neglect reported to it that is alleged to have occurred as a result of the action of a person responsible for the child’s welfare, or as the result of the failure of a person responsible for the child’s welfare to adequately protect the minor from abuse when the person responsible for the child’s welfare knew or reasonably should have known that the minor was in danger of abuse. A law enforcement agency also shall send by fax or electronic transmission a written report thereof within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the incident to any agency to which it makes a telephone report under this subdivision.

The State Department of Social Services shall provide guidance through written directives to counties participating in the program to incorporate qualifying questions in the online report that would indicate the need to redirect the mandated reporter to perform a telephone report.

(3) The mandated reporter is required to complete all required fields, including identity and contact information of the mandated reporter, in order to submit the report.

(4) The agency provides an internet-based reporting system that has appropriate security protocols to preserve the confidentiality of the reports and any documents or photographs submitted through the system.

(f) An employee or designated agent of a child and family advocacy center that meets the requirements of subdivision (b) is immune from any civil liability that arises from the employee’s or designated agent’s participation in the investigation process and services provided by the child and family advocacy center, unless the employee or designated agent acted with malice or has been charged with or is suspected of abusing or neglecting the child who is the subject of the investigation or services provided. This subdivision does not supersede or limit any other immunity provided by law.

###### 11171.



(a) (1) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that adequate protection of victims of child physical abuse or neglect has been hampered by the lack of consistent and comprehensive medical examinations.

(2) Enhancing examination procedures, documentation, and evidence collection relating to child abuse or neglect will improve the investigation and prosecution of child abuse or neglect as well as other child protection efforts.

(b) The Office of Emergency Services shall, in cooperation with the State Department of Social Services, the Department of Justice, the California Association of Crime Lab Directors, the California District Attorneys Association, the California State Sheriffs’ Association, the California Peace Officers Association, the California Medical Association, the California Police Chiefs’ Association, child advocates, the California Medical Training Center, child protective services, and other appropriate experts, establish medical forensic forms, instructions, and examination protocols for victims of child physical abuse or neglect using as a model the form and guidelines developed pursuant to Section 13823.5.

(c) The forms shall include, but not be limited to, a place for notation concerning each of the following:

(1) Any notification of injuries or any report of suspected child physical abuse or neglect to law enforcement authorities or children’s protective services, in accordance with existing reporting procedures.

(d) The forms shall become part of the patient’s medical record pursuant to guidelines established by the advisory committee of the Office of Emergency Services and subject to the confidentiality laws pertaining to the release of medical forensic examination records.

(e) The forms shall be made accessible for use in an electronic format.

(f) The costs associated with the medical evidentiary examination of a victim of child physical abuse or neglect shall be separate from diagnostic treatment and procedure costs associated with medical treatment. Costs for the medical evidentiary portion of the examination shall not be charged directly or indirectly to the victim of child physical abuse or neglect.

(g) Each county’s board of supervisors shall authorize a designee to approve the Sexual Assault Response Teams (SART), Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner (SAFE) teams, or other qualified medical evidentiary examiners to receive reimbursement through the Office of Emergency Services for the performance of medical evidentiary examinations for victims of child physical abuse or neglect and shall notify the Office of Emergency Services of this designation. The costs associated with these medical evidentiary exams shall be funded by the state, subject to appropriation by the Legislature. Each county’s designated SART, SAFE, or other qualified medical evidentiary examiners shall submit invoices to the Office of Emergency Service, who shall administer the program. A flat reimbursement rate shall be established. Within one year upon initial appropriation, the Office of Emergency Service shall establish a 60-day reimbursement process.

###### 11172.



(a) No mandated reporter shall be civilly or criminally liable for any report required or authorized by this article, and this immunity shall apply even if the mandated reporter acquired the knowledge or reasonable suspicion of child abuse or neglect outside of their professional capacity or outside the scope of their employment. Any other person reporting a known or suspected instance of child abuse or neglect shall not incur civil or criminal liability as a result of any report authorized by this article unless it can be proven that a false report was made and the person knew that the report was false or was made with reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the report, and any person who makes a report of child abuse or neglect known to be false or with reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the report is liable for any damages caused. No person required to make a report pursuant to this article, nor any person taking photographs at their direction, shall incur any civil or criminal liability for taking photographs of a suspected victim of child abuse or neglect, or causing photographs to be taken of a suspected victim of child abuse or neglect, without parental consent, or for disseminating the photographs, images, or material with the reports required by this article. However, this section shall not be construed to grant immunity from this liability with respect to any other use of the photographs.

(b) Any person, who, pursuant to a request from a government agency investigating a report of suspected child abuse or neglect, provides the requesting agency with access to the victim of a known or suspected instance of child abuse or neglect shall not incur civil or criminal liability as a result of providing that access.

(c) Any commercial computer technician, and any employer of any commercial computer technician, who, pursuant to a warrant from a law enforcement agency investigating a report of suspected child abuse or neglect, provides the law enforcement agency with a computer or computer component which contains possible evidence of a known or suspected instance of child abuse or neglect, shall not incur civil or criminal liability as a result of providing that computer or computer component to the law enforcement agency.

(d) Any person who, in good faith, provides information or assistance, including medical evaluations or consultations, to an agency specified in Section 11165.9, in connection with a report, investigation, or legal intervention pursuant to a good faith report of child abuse or neglect under this article, shall not incur civil or criminal liability as a result of providing that information or assistance. This subdivision does not grant immunity from liability for an individual who is suspected of committing abuse or neglect of the child who is the subject of the report.

(e) (1) The Legislature finds that even though it has provided immunity from liability to persons required or authorized to make reports pursuant to this article, that immunity does not eliminate the possibility that actions may be brought against those persons based upon required or authorized reports. In order to further limit the financial hardship that those persons may incur as a result of fulfilling their legal responsibilities, it is necessary that they not be unfairly burdened by legal fees incurred in defending those actions. Therefore, a mandated reporter may present a claim to the Department of General Services for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in any action against that person on the basis of making a report required or authorized by this article if the court has dismissed the action upon a demurrer or motion for summary judgment made by that person, or if they prevail in the action. The Department of General Services shall allow that claim if the requirements of this subdivision are met, and the claim shall be paid from an appropriation to be made for that purpose. Attorney’s fees awarded pursuant to this section shall not exceed an hourly rate greater than the rate charged by the Attorney General of the State of California at the time the award is made and shall not exceed an aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).

(2) This subdivision shall not apply if a public entity has provided for the defense of the action pursuant to Section 995 of the Government Code.

(f) A court may award attorney’s fees and costs to a commercial film and photographic print processor when a suit is brought against the processor because of a disclosure mandated by this article and the court finds this suit to be frivolous.

(2) Regulations designed to assure the community treatment facilities, day treatment facilities, group homes, and foster family agencies licensed to care for children maintain a written protocol for the investigation and reporting of child abuse or neglect, as defined in Section 11165.6, alleged to have occurred involving a child placed in the facility.

(c) The State Department of Social Services shall provide such orientation and training as it deems necessary to assure that its officers, employees, or agents who conduct inspections of facilities licensed to care for children are knowledgeable about the reporting requirements of this article and have adequate training to identify conditions leading to, and the signs of, child abuse or neglect, as defined in Section 11165.6.

_(Amended by Stats. 2000, Ch. 916, Sec. 32. Effective January 1, 2001.)_

###### 11174.3.



(a) Whenever a representative of a government agency investigating suspected child abuse or neglect or the State Department of Social Services deems it necessary, a suspected victim of child abuse or neglect may be interviewed during school hours, on school premises, concerning a report of suspected child abuse or neglect that occurred within the child’s home or out-of-home care facility. The child shall be afforded the option of being interviewed in private or selecting any adult who is a member of the staff of the school, including any certificated or classified employee or volunteer aide, to be present at the interview. A representative of the agency investigating suspected child abuse or neglect or the State Department of Social Services shall inform the child of that right prior to the interview.

The purpose of the staff person’s presence at the interview is to lend support to the child and enable him or her to be as comfortable as possible. However, the member of the staff so elected shall not participate in the interview. The member of the staff so present shall not discuss the facts or circumstances of the case with the child. The member of the staff so present, including, but not limited to, a volunteer aide, is subject to the confidentiality requirements of this article, a violation of which is punishable as specified in Section 11167.5. A representative of the school shall inform a member of the staff so selected by a child of the requirements of this section prior to the interview. A staff member selected by a child may decline the request to be present at the interview. If the staff person selected agrees to be present, the interview shall be held at a time during school hours when it does not involve an expense to the school. Failure to comply with the requirements of this section does not affect the admissibility of evidence in a criminal or civil proceeding.

(b) The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall notify each school district and each agency specified in Section 11165.9 to receive mandated reports, and the State Department of Social Services shall notify each of its employees who participate in the investigation of reports of child abuse or neglect, of the requirements of this section.

Pursuant to the authority vested in this State by that certain act of Congress, approved June 6, 1934, and entitled “An act granting the consent of Congress to any two or more states to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime, and for other purposes,” the Governor is hereby authorized and directed to enter into a compact or compacts on behalf of this State with any of the United States legally joining therein.

_(Added by Stats. 1953, Ch. 1384.)_

###### 11177.



The compact or compacts authorized by Section 11176 shall be in substantially the following form:

A compact entered into by and among the contracting states, signatories hereto, with the consent of the Congress of the United States of America, granted by an act entitled “An act granting the consent of Congress to any two or more states to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and for other purposes.”

The contracting states solemnly agree:

(1) That it shall be competent for the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact (herein called “sending state”), to permit any person convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or released on parole to reside in any other state party to this compact (herein called “receiving state”) while on probation or parole, if

(a) Such person is in fact a resident of or has his family residing within the receiving state and can obtain employment there;

(b) Though not a resident of the receiving state and not having his family residing there, the receiving state consents to such person being sent there.

Before granting such permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person.

A resident of the receiving state, within the meaning of this section, is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than one year prior to his coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state more than six continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted.

(2) That each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation of and supervision over probationers or parolees of any sending state and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.

(3) That duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto, as to such persons. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state. If at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee there should be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense.

(4) That the duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states parties to this compact, without interference.

(5) That the governor of each state may designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other contracting states, if and when appointed, shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to more effectively carry out the terms of this compact.

(6) That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its ratification by any state as between it and any other state or states so ratifying. When ratified it shall have the full force and effect of law within such state, the form of ratification to be in accordance with the laws of the ratifying state.

(7) That this compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each ratifying state until renounced by it. The duties and obligations hereunder of a renouncing state shall continue as to parolees or probationers residing therein at the time of withdrawal until retaken or finally discharged by the sending state. Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which ratified it, by sending six months’ notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other states party hereto.

_(Added by Stats. 1953, Ch. 1384.)_

###### 11177.1.



(a) Before a probationer or parolee may be returned to the sending state under this compact, he shall have a right to counsel and to a hearing before a magistrate to determine whether he is in fact a probationer or parolee who was allowed to reside in this or any other state pursuant to this compact, whether his return to the sending state has been ordered, and whether there is probable cause to believe he is the same person whose return is sought. At the hearing, the magistrate shall accept certified copies of probation or parole documents showing that this compact has been invoked and that the probationer or parolee has been ordered returned to the sending state, and these documents shall constitute conclusive proof of their contents. If the magistrate concludes that the probationer or parolee is subject to the terms of this compact, an order shall be issued forthwith directing the delivery to the sending state of the probationer or parolee.

(b) If the probationer or parolee or his counsel desires to test the legality of the order issued under subdivision (a), the magistrate shall fix a reasonable time to be allowed him within which to apply for a writ of habeas corpus. If the writ is denied and probable cause appears for an application for a writ of habeas corpus to another court, or justice or judge thereof, the order denying the writ shall fix a reasonable time within which the accused may again apply for a writ of habeas corpus.

In any matter relating to the return of such a person, any agent so deputized shall have all the powers of a police officer of this State.

The Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision as contained herein is hereby enacted into law and entered into on behalf of the state with any and all other states legally joining therein in a form substantially as follows:

Preamble

Whereas:The interstate compact for the supervision of Parolees and Probationers was established in 1937. It is the earliest corrections “compact” established among the states and has not been amended since its adoption over 62 years ago.

Whereas:This compact is the only vehicle for the controlled movement of adult parolees and probationers across state lines and it currently has jurisdiction over more than a quarter of a million offenders.

Whereas:The complexities of the compact have become more difficult to administer, and many jurisdictions have expanded supervision expectations to include currently unregulated practices such as victim input, victim notification requirements, and sex offender registration.

Whereas:After hearings, national surveys, and a detailed study by a task force appointed by the National Institute of Corrections, the overwhelming recommendation has been to amend the document to bring about an effective management capacity that addresses public safety concerns and offender accountability.

Whereas:Upon the adoption of this Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, it is the intention of the Legislature to repeal the previous Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers as to those states that have ratified this compact.

Be it enacted by the General Assembly (Legislature) of the state of California.

Short title:This Act may be cited as The Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision.

Article I.Purpose

The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the Bylaws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in a manner so as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: create an Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in these types of activities. The compacting states recognize that there is no “right” of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and Bylaws and Rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

Article VIII.Rulemaking Functions of the Interstate Commission

The Interstate Commission shall promulgate Rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the Compact including transition rules governing administration of the compact during the period in which it is being considered and enacted by the states.

Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Article and the By-laws and Rules adopted pursuant thereto. Rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.S. section 551 et seq., and the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C.S. app. 2, section 1 et seq., as may be amended (hereinafter “APA”). All Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each Rule or amendment.

If a majority of the legislatures of the Compacting States rejects a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then the Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Compacting State.

When promulgating a Rule, the Interstate Commission shall:

Publish the proposed Rule stating with particularity the text of the Rule which is proposed and the reason for the proposed Rule.

Allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be publicly available.

Not later than sixty days after a Rule is promulgated, any interested person may file a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Federal District Court where the Interstate Commission’s principal office is located for judicial review of the Rule. If the court finds that the Interstate Commission’s action is not supported by substantial evidence, (as defined in the APA), in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the Rule unlawful and set it aside. Subjects to be addressed within 12 months after the first meeting must at a minimum include:

Notice to victims and opportunity to be heard.

Offender registration and compliance.

Violations/returns.

Transfer procedures and forms.

Eligibility for transfer.

Collection of restitution and fees from offenders.

Data collection and reporting.

The level of supervision to be provided by the receiving state.

Mediation, arbitration and dispute resolution.

The existing rules governing the operation of the previous compact superseded by this Act shall be null and void twelve (12) months after the first meeting of the Interstate Commission created hereunder.

Upon determination by the Interstate Commission that an emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule which shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be retroactively applied to said rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule.

Article IX.Oversight, Enforcement, and Dispute Resolution by the Interstate Commission

Section A.Oversight

The Interstate Commission shall oversee the interstate movement of adult offenders in the compacting states and shall monitor the activities being administered in Non-compacting States which may significantly affect Compacting States.

The courts and executive agencies in each Compacting State shall enforce this Compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact’s purposes and intent. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a Compacting State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission, the Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.

Section B.Dispute Resolution

The Compacting States shall report to the Interstate Commission on issues or activities of concern to them, and cooperate with and support the Interstate Commission in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities.

The Interstate Commission shall attempt to resolve any disputes or other issues which are subject to the Compact and which may arise among Compacting States and Non-compacting States.

The Interstate Commission shall enact a By-law or promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among the Compacting States.

Section C.Enforcement

The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this compact using any or all means set forth in Article XII, Section B, of this compact.

Article X.Finance

The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.

The Interstate Commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each Compacting State to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission’s annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of the state and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each Compacting State and shall promulgate a Rule binding upon all Compacting States which governs said assessment.

The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state. The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its By-laws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.

Article XI.Compacting States, Effective Date and Amendment

Any state, as defined in Article II of this compact, is eligible to become a Compacting State. The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the Compact into law by no less than 35 of the States. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2001, or upon enactment into law by the 35th jurisdiction. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding, as to any other Compacting State, upon enactment of the Compact into law by that State. The governors of Non-member states or their designees will be invited to participate in Interstate Commission activities on a non-voting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.

Amendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Interstate Commission for enactment by the Compacting States. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the Compacting States.

Article XII.Withdrawal, Default, Termination, and Judicial Enforcement

Section A.Withdrawal

Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State; provided, that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact (“Withdrawing State”) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law.

The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal. The Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the Chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the Withdrawing State. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other Compacting States of the Withdrawing State’s intent to withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof. The Withdrawing State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.

Reinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur upon the Withdrawing State reenacting the Compact or upon a later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.

Section B.Default

If the Interstate Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted (“Defaulting State”) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the By-laws or any duly promulgated Rules the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties: Fines, fees and costs in amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission. Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission; suspension and termination of membership in the compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the By-laws and Rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and the State Council.

The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform the obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, Interstate Commission By-laws, or duly promulgated Rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the Defaulting State pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the Defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Compacting States and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a Defaulting State, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Defaulting State’s legislature and the state council of the termination.

The Defaulting State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.

The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the Defaulting State unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the Defaulting State. Reinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires both a reenactment of the Compact by the Defaulting State and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the Rules.

Section C.Judicial Enforcement

The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the Members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the Federal District where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact, its duly promulgated Rules and By-laws, against any Compacting State in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all litigation costs including reasonable attorneys fees.

Section D.Dissolution of Compact

The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State which reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State.

Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the By-laws.

Article XIII.Severability and Construction

The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Compact shall be enforceable.

The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally constructed to effectuate its purposes.

Article XIV.Binding Effect of Compact and Other Laws

Section A.Other Laws

Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Compacting State that is not inconsistent with this Compact.

All Compacting States’ laws conflicting with this Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.

Section B.Binding Effect of the Compact

All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all Rules and By-laws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the Compacting States.

All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States are binding in accordance with their terms.

Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the Compacting States, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding meaning or interpretation.

In the event any provision of this Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any Compacting State, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by the provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the Compacting State and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this Compact becomes effective.

1. Its duration.

2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance.

(b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.

(c) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III.

(d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.

(e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution.

In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.

(i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact.

Article V

Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State: Extradition

(a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.

(b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated.

Article VII

Entry Into Force

This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state.

Article VIII

Withdrawal and Termination

This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.

Article IX

Other Arrangements Unaffected

Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.

Article X

Construction and Severability

The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

Withdrawal and Termination

This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until two years after the notices provided in said statute have been sent.

Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.

 Article IX

Other Arrangements Unaffected

Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of co-operative institutional arrangements.

 Article X

Construction and Severability

The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

###### 11228.



Actions brought under this article have precedence over all actions, excepting criminal proceedings, election contests and hearings on injunctions, and in such actions evidence of the general reputation of a place is admissible for the purpose of proving the existence of a nuisance.

(a) (1) If the existence of a nuisance is established in an action as provided in this article, an order of abatement shall be entered as a part of the judgment in the case, directing the removal from the building or place of all fixtures, musical instruments and movable property used in conducting, maintaining, aiding, or abetting the nuisance, and directing the sale thereof in the manner provided for the sale of chattels under execution, and the effectual closing of the building or place against its use for any purpose, and that it be kept closed for a period of one year, unless sooner released. If the court finds that any vacancy resulting from closure of the building or place may create a nuisance or that closure is otherwise harmful to the community, in lieu of ordering the building or place closed, the court may order the person who is responsible for the existence of the nuisance to pay damages in an amount equal to the fair market rental value of the building or place for one year to the city or county in whose jurisdiction the nuisance is located. The actual amount of rent being received for the rental of the building or place, or the existence of any vacancy therein, may be considered, but shall not be the sole determinant of the fair market rental value. Expert testimony may be used to determine the fair market rental value.

(2) While the order remains in effect as to closing, the building or place is and shall remain in the custody of the court.

(3) For removing and selling the movable property, the officer is entitled to charge and receive the same fees as he or she would for levying upon and selling like property on execution.

(4) For closing the premises and keeping them closed, a reasonable sum shall be allowed by the court.

(b) The court may assess a civil penalty not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) against any and all of the defendants, based upon the severity of the nuisance and its duration.

(d) In cases involving human trafficking, one-half of the civil penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the Victim-Witness Assistance Fund to be available for appropriation by the Legislature to the California Emergency Management Agency to fund grants for human trafficking victim services and prevention programs provided by community-based organizations. The community-based organizations shall have trained human trafficking caseworkers, as defined by Section 1038.2 of the Evidence Code. The other one-half of the civil penalties shall be paid to the city in which judgment was entered, if the action was brought by a city attorney or city prosecutor. If the action was brought by a district attorney, the one-half of the civil penalty shall, instead, be paid to the treasurer of the county in which judgment was entered.

If the person is acquitted of the primary offense the stay shall be permanent.

(f) If the person is convicted of a felony for the primary offense, is granted probation for the primary offense, and is convicted of a felony for the secondary offense, any sentence for the secondary offense shall be enhanced as provided in subdivision (b).

(g) If the primary offense conviction is reversed on appeal, the enhancement shall be suspended pending retrial of that felony. Upon retrial and reconviction, the enhancement shall be reimposed. If the person is no longer in custody for the secondary offense upon reconviction of the primary offense, the court may, at its discretion, reimpose the enhancement and order him or her recommitted to custody.

Any disclosure made pursuant to this subdivision shall only be made upon agreement by the public defender’s office, alternate public defender’s office, or the licensed attorney of record in a criminal case. Any disclosure pursuant to this subdivision shall not constitute disclosure under any other law, nor shall any privilege or confidentiality be deemed waived by that disclosure. This subdivision shall not be construed to otherwise limit any legal mandate to disclose evidence or information, including, but not limited to, the disclosures required under Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 1054) of Title 6 of Part 2.

###### 13370.



(a) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature to create a workable system of criminal justice data transparency whereby law enforcement prosecution agencies will gather complete, accurate, and timely data in a uniform format, and make that data available to the public in a modern, open, electronic format that is machine-readable and readily accessible through an application program interface. In order that meaningful discussions can occur regarding criminal justice and its most challenging issues, including those regarding criminal caseloads, plea bargaining, race, mass incarceration, equity, and homelessness, the Legislature finds that it is an important state interest to implement a data collection, aggregation, and publishing process for criminal prosecutions to promote criminal justice data transparency. This data would be comprised of publishable statistics and other data from statewide prosecution offices. This section shall be referred to as the Justice Data Accountability and Transparency Act, “the Act,” or “JDATA.”

(2) It is the intent of the Legislature to create a reliable and robust methodology that is consistent county-to-county so that statewide data and trends may be accurately tracked. Further, the legislation shall set low technological and resource barriers so that every affected office may meaningfully participate to the fullest intent of this article.

(3) The expediency and accuracy of the data is best served by the Department of Justice as a single data aggregator and repository unit. The participation of the department as the final point of collection, aggregation, and publishing of this data is more efficient, will ensure the uniformity and accuracy of the data, and, by providing the technological resources and aggregation and publication of all data, will allow offices that lack adequate technology or resources to comply with the mandate. As used in this paragraph, technological resources means providing the basic systems and support necessary to receive the case data described in this article in standard formats from prosecution agencies statewide and aggregate that data using appropriate means developed by the department, and then publish the data in a format that will allow users to easily navigate and access the data they require, for example, on an internet website.

(b) (1) The department shall have the following objectives and mandate:

(A) Collection of the data described in subdivision (e), hereinafter referred to as data elements, within the timeframes described in this section from all state and local prosecutor offices that prosecute misdemeanors or felonies or both, including county district attorney offices, city attorney offices, and the Attorney General, hereinafter referred to as agencies. Collection of data elements includes providing cooperation and assistance to participating agencies and developing consistent and clear guidelines for how agencies are to define data elements transmitted to the department. The department shall develop consistent definitions and formats for data elements to ensure success of comparing metrics created using said data elements between jurisdictions.

(B) Transmission of data elements, defined as the method designated by the department for the participating agency to provide collected data elements to the department.

(C) Aggregation of data elements, defined as collecting data elements gathered from multiple agencies in such a way that they can support metrics, defined as the combination of data elements used to track outcomes on any given process or decision point, developed by the department, that may be compared between jurisdictions.

(D) Development of metrics, defined as using industry-appropriate methods and technology and cooperation with participating agencies to create accurate, actionable, and digestible metrics using data elements submitted by the agencies. The methods implemented must ensure that the metrics developed can be compared between jurisdictions.

(E) Consistent with subdivision (g), publication of metrics, defined as using appropriate technology, methods, and interface design to make metrics available to the public, which may include the use of web publishing, the use of interactive portals or other applications to not only display metrics, but to allow metrics to be compared and filtered so that each metric may be analyzed and dissected by multiple factors, including other metrics and filters including, but not limited to, defendant, victim, and case characteristics. This publication shall be made using a modern, open, and electronic format, such as comma-separated values (CSV) or similar file format, that will allow the user to download the data sets and conduct their own analyses. The public interface for metrics shall also make raw, case-level data available for download so that independent analyses can be conducted using the data. The department shall also ensure that personal identifying information is not published except as allowed by law, and the use of anonymized data may be employed for this purpose.

(F) By October 1, 2023, the department shall establish the Prosecutorial Transparency Advisory Board for the purpose of ensuring transparency, accountability, and equitable access to prosecutorial data.

###### 13510.8.



(a) (1) The commission shall revoke the certification of a certified peace officer if the person is or has become ineligible to hold office as a peace officer pursuant to Section 1029 of the Government Code.

(2) The commission may suspend or revoke the certification of a peace officer if the person has been terminated for cause from employment as a peace officer for, or has, while employed as a peace officer, otherwise engaged in, any serious misconduct as described in subdivision (b).

(3) The commission may cancel the certificate or proof of eligibility of a peace officer if the commission determines that there was fraud or misrepresentation made by an applicant at any time during the application process that resulted in the issuance of the certification.

(b) By January 1, 2023, the commission shall adopt by regulation a definition of “serious misconduct” that shall serve as the criteria to be considered for ineligibility for, or revocation of, certification. This definition shall include all of the following:

(1) Dishonesty relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, a peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, false statements, intentionally filing false reports, tampering with, falsifying, destroying, or concealing evidence, perjury, and tampering with data recorded by a body-worn camera or other recording device for purposes of concealing misconduct.

(2) Abuse of power, including, but not limited to, intimidating witnesses, knowingly obtaining a false confession, and knowingly making a false arrest.

(3) Physical abuse, including, but not limited to, the excessive or unreasonable use of force.

(4) Sexual assault, as described in subdivision (b) of Section 832.7.

(5) Demonstrating bias on the basis of race, national origin, religion, gender identity or expression, housing status, sexual orientation, mental or physical disability, or other protected status in violation of law or department policy or inconsistent with a peace officer’s obligation to carry out their duties in a fair and unbiased manner. This paragraph does not limit an employee’s rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

(6) Acts that violate the law and are sufficiently egregious or repeated as to be inconsistent with a peace officer’s obligation to uphold the law or respect the rights of members of the public, as determined by the commission.

(7) Participation in a law enforcement gang. For the purpose of this paragraph, a “law enforcement gang” means a group of peace officers within a law enforcement agency who may identify themselves by a name and may be associated with an identifying symbol, including, but not limited to, matching tattoos, and who engage in a pattern of on-duty behavior that intentionally violates the law or fundamental principles of professional policing, including, but not limited to, excluding, harassing, or discriminating against any individual based on a protected category under federal or state antidiscrimination laws, engaging in or promoting conduct that violates the rights of other employees or members of the public, violating agency policy, the persistent practice of unlawful detention or use of excessive force in circumstances where it is known to be unjustified, falsifying police reports, fabricating or destroying evidence, targeting persons for enforcement based solely on protected characteristics of those persons, theft, unauthorized use of alcohol or drugs on duty, unlawful or unauthorized protection of other members from disciplinary actions, and retaliation against other officers who threaten or interfere with the activities of the group.

(8) Failure to cooperate with an investigation into potential police misconduct, including an investigation conducted pursuant to this chapter. For purposes of this paragraph, the lawful exercise of rights granted under the United States Constitution, the California Constitution, or any other law shall not be considered a failure to cooperate.

(9) Failure to intercede when present and observing another officer using force that is clearly beyond that which is necessary, as determined by an objectively reasonable officer under the circumstances, taking into account the possibility that other officers may have additional information regarding the threat posed by a subject.

(c) (1) Beginning no later than January 1, 2023, each law enforcement agency shall be responsible for the completion of investigations of allegations of serious misconduct by a peace officer, regardless of their employment status.

(2) The division shall promptly review any grounds for decertification described in subdivision (a) received from an agency. The division shall have the authority to review any agency or other investigative authority file, as well as to conduct additional investigation, if necessary. The division shall only have authority to review and investigate allegations for purposes of decertification.

(3) (A) The board, in their discretion, may request that the division review an investigative file or recommend that the commission direct the division to investigate any potential grounds for decertification of a peace officer. Those requests and recommendations from the board to the division or commission must be based upon a decision by a majority vote.

(B) The commission, in its discretion, may direct the division to review an investigative file. The commission, either upon its own motion or in response to a recommendation from the board, may direct the division to investigate any potential grounds for decertification of a peace officer.

(C) The division, in its discretion, may investigate without the request of the commission or board any potential grounds for revocation of certification of a peace officer.

(4) The division, in carrying out any investigation initiated pursuant to this section or any other duty shall have all of the powers of investigation granted pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 11180) of Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.

(5) Notwithstanding any other law, the investigation shall be completed within three years after the receipt of the completed report of the disciplinary or internal affairs investigation from the employing agency pursuant to Section 13510.9, however, no time limit shall apply if a report of the conduct was not made to the commission. An investigation shall be considered completed upon a notice of intent to deny, suspend, or revoke certification issued pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 13510.85. The time limit shall be tolled during the appeal of a termination or other disciplinary action through an administrative or judicial proceeding or during any criminal prosecution of the peace officer. The commission shall consider the peace officer’s prior conduct and service record, and any instances of misconduct, including any incidents occurring beyond the time limitation for investigation in evaluating whether to revoke certification for the incident under investigation.

(6) An action by an agency or decision resulting from an appeal of an agency’s action does not preclude action by the commission to investigate, suspend, or revoke a peace officer’s certification pursuant to this section. Whether a particular factual or legal determination in a prior appeal proceeding shall have preclusive effect in proceedings under this chapter shall be governed by the existing law of collateral estoppel.

(d) Upon arrest or indictment of a peace officer for any crime described in Section 1029 of the Government Code, or discharge from any law enforcement agency for grounds set forth in subdivision (a), or separation from employment of a peace officer during a pending investigation into allegations of serious misconduct, the executive director shall order the immediate temporary suspension of any certificate or proof of eligibility held by that peace officer upon the determination by the executive director that the temporary suspension is in the best interest of the health, safety, or welfare of the public. The order of temporary suspension shall be made in writing and shall specify the basis for the executive director’s determination. Following the issuance of a temporary suspension order, proceedings of the commission in the exercise of its authority to discipline any peace officer shall be promptly scheduled as provided for in this section. The temporary suspension shall continue in effect until issuance of the final decision on revocation pursuant to this section or until the order is withdrawn by the executive director.

(e) Records of an investigation of any person by the commission shall be retained for 30 years following the date that the investigation is deemed concluded by the commission. The commission may destroy records prior to the expiration of the 30-year retention period if the subject is deceased and no action upon the complaint was taken by the commission beyond the commission’s initial intake of the complaint.

(f) Any peace officer may voluntarily surrender their certification permanently. Voluntary permanent surrender of certification pursuant to this subdivision shall have the same effect as revocation. Voluntary permanent surrender is not the same as placement of a valid certification into inactive status during a period in which a person is not actively employed as a peace officer. A permanently surrendered certification cannot be reactivated.

(g) (1) The commission may initiate proceedings to revoke or suspend a peace officer’s certification for conduct that occurred before January 1, 2022, only for either of the following:

(A) Serious misconduct pursuant to paragraph (1) or (4) of subdivision (b) or pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) for the use of deadly force that results in death or serious bodily injury.

(B) If the employing agency makes a final determination regarding its investigation of the misconduct after January 1, 2022.

(2) Nothing in this subdivision prevents the commission from considering the peace officer’s prior conduct and service record in determining whether suspension or revocation is appropriate for serious misconduct.

(2) Upon notification, the peace officer may, within 30 days, file a request for a review of the determination by the board and commission.

(3) The board shall meet as required to conduct public hearings, but no fewer than four times per year.

(4) At each public hearing, the board shall review the findings of investigations presented by the division pursuant to paragraph (1) and shall make a recommendation on what action should be taken on the certification of the peace officer involved.

The board shall issue a written decision explaining its reasons for decertification or suspension.

(5) The commission shall review all recommendations made by the board. The commission’s decision to adopt a recommendation by the board to seek revocation shall require a two-thirds vote of commissioners present and shall be based on whether the record, in its entirety, supports the board’s conclusion that serious misconduct has been established by clear and convincing evidence. In any case in which the commission reaches a different determination than the board’s recommendation, it shall set forth its analysis and reasons for reaching a different determination in writing.

(6) The commission shall return any determination requiring action to be taken against an individual’s certification to the division, which shall initiate proceedings for a formal hearing before an administrative law judge in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), which shall be subject to judicial review as set forth in that act.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 832.7, the hearings of the board and the review by the commission under this section, administrative adjudications held pursuant to paragraph (6) of subdivision (a), and any records introduced during those proceedings, shall be public.

This subdivision does not preclude the board or the commission, or both, from reviewing the unredacted versions of these records in closed session and using them as the basis for any action taken.

(c) The commission shall publish the names of any peace officer whose certification is suspended or revoked and the basis for the suspension or revocation and shall notify the National Decertification Index of the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training of the suspension or revocation.

This information may be withheld from the subject peace officer if the commission determines that disclosure pursuant to this section may jeopardize an ongoing investigation, put a victim or witness at risk of any form of harm or injury, or may otherwise create a risk of any form of harm or injury that outweighs the interest in disclosure, until the risk of harm or injury is ended or mitigated so that the interest in disclosure is no longer outweighed by the interest in nondisclosure. Information that the commission releases to an agency pursuant to this section that has been withheld from the subject peace officer shall be kept confidential by the receiving agency.

(5) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting the changes to this section made by the act that added this paragraph that additional training is required to address the pernicious practice of racial or identity profiling and that enactment of this section is in no way dispositive of the issue of how the state should deal with racial or identity profiling.

The activities include, but are not limited to, traffic or pedestrian stops, or actions during a stop, such as asking questions, frisks, consensual and nonconsensual searches of a person or any property, seizing any property, removing vehicle occupants during a traffic stop, issuing a citation, and making an arrest.

(i) The names and phone numbers of or local county hotlines for, or both the phone numbers of and local county hotlines for, local shelters for victims of domestic violence and rape victim counseling centers within the county, including those centers specified in Section 13837, and their 24-hour counseling service telephone numbers.

(a) Each law enforcement agency shall develop a system, by January 1, 1986, for recording all domestic violence-related calls for assistance made to the department, including whether weapons are involved, or whether the incident involved strangulation or suffocation. All domestic violence-related calls for assistance shall be supported with a written incident report, as described in subdivision (c), identifying the domestic violence incident. Monthly, the total number of domestic violence calls received and the numbers of those cases involving weapons or strangulation or suffocation shall be compiled by each law enforcement agency and submitted to the Attorney General.

(b) The Attorney General shall report annually to the Governor, the Legislature, and the public the total number of domestic violence-related calls received by California law enforcement agencies, the number of cases involving weapons, the number of cases involving strangulation or suffocation, and a breakdown of calls received by agency, city, and county.

(c) Each law enforcement agency shall develop an incident report form that includes a domestic violence identification code by January 1, 1986. In all incidents of domestic violence, a report shall be written and shall be identified on the face of the report as a domestic violence incident. The report shall include at least all of the following:

(1) A notation of whether the officer or officers who responded to the domestic violence call observed any signs that the alleged abuser was under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance.

(2) A notation of whether the officer or officers who responded to the domestic violence call determined if any law enforcement agency had previously responded to a domestic violence call at the same address involving the same alleged abuser or victim.

(3) A notation of whether the officer or officers who responded to the domestic violence call found it necessary, for the protection of the peace officer or other persons present, to inquire of the victim, the alleged abuser, or both, whether a firearm or other deadly weapon was present at the location, and, if there is an inquiry, whether that inquiry disclosed the presence of a firearm or other deadly weapon. Any firearm or other deadly weapon discovered by an officer at the scene of a domestic violence incident shall be subject to confiscation pursuant to Division 4 (commencing with Section 18250) of Title 2 of Part 6.

(4) A notation of whether there were indications that the incident involved strangulation or suffocation. This includes whether any witness or victim reported any incident of strangulation or suffocation, whether any victim reported symptoms of strangulation or suffocation, or whether the officer observed any signs of strangulation or suffocation.

###### 13731.



(a) The San Diego Association of Governments may serve as the regional clearinghouse for criminal justice data involving domestic violence. The association may obtain monthly crime statistics from all law enforcement agencies in San Diego County. These law enforcement agencies may include their domestic violence supplements in the monthly crime reports that are supplied to the association. The association may obtain client-based data regarding clients or victims of domestic violence who seek protection in San Diego County shelters.

(b) Contingent upon the appropriation of funds therefor, the association shall do all of the following:

(1) Create a standardized, uniform intake form, to be referred to as a Compilation of Research and Evaluation Intake Instrument, also known as C.O.R.E., for use in San Diego County’s domestic violence shelters. This form shall be completed and ready to use in the field for data collection purposes not later than March 31, 1997. The C.O.R.E. intake form shall be standardized to compile the same information from all clients for all shelters.

(2) Collect and analyze the standardized, uniform intake form in order to compile information including, but not limited to, victim sociodemographic characteristics, descriptions of domestic violence incidents pertaining to each victim and services needed by domestic violence shelter clients within San Diego County.

(3) Use the collected client-based data to describe the nature and scope of violence from the perspective of domestic violence shelter clients and to determine the service needs of clients and what gaps in service delivery exist, so that resources can be appropriately targeted and allocated. All data supplied to the association shall be stripped of any information regarding the personal identity of an individual to protect the privacy of domestic violence shelter clients.

(4) Establish an advisory committee in order to facilitate the research effort and to assess the value of the research project. The advisory committee shall consist of representation from the shelters, as well as members of the San Diego County Domestic Violence Council, local justice administrators, and the principal investigator. The advisory committee shall meet at least four times before April 30, 1999, to review the progress of the research, including research methodology, data collection instruments, preliminary analyses, and work product as they are drafted. Advisory committee members shall evaluate the final research product in terms of applicability and utility of findings and recommendations.

_(Amended by Stats. 2001, Ch. 745, Sec. 163. Effective October 12, 2001.)_

###### 13732.



(a) The Legislature finds and declares that a substantial body of research demonstrates a strong connection between domestic violence and child abuse. However, despite this connection, child abuse and domestic violence services and agencies often fail to coordinate appropriately at the local level. It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to improve preventative and supportive services to families experiencing violence in order to prevent further abuse of children and the victims of domestic violence. It is the further intent of this section that child protective services agencies develop a protocol which clearly sets forth the criteria for a child protective services response to a domestic violence related incident in a home in which a child resides.

(b) Commencing January 1, 2003, child protective services agencies, law enforcement, prosecution, child abuse and domestic violence experts, and community-based organizations serving abused children and victims of domestic violence shall develop, in collaboration with one another, protocols as to how law enforcement and child welfare agencies will cooperate in their response to incidents of domestic violence in homes in which a child resides. The requirements of this section shall not apply to counties where protocols consistent with this section already have been developed.

_(Amended by Stats. 2021, Ch. 83, Sec. 3. (SB 157) Effective July 16, 2021.)_

###### 13823.2.



(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:

(1) That violent and serious crimes are being committed against the elderly on an alarmingly regular basis.

(2) That in 1985, the United States Department of Justice reported that approximately 1 in every 10 elderly households in the nation would be touched by crime.

(3) That the California Department of Justice, based upon limited data received from local law enforcement agencies, reported that approximately 10,000 violent crimes were committed against elderly victims in 1985.

(4) That while the elderly may not be the most frequent targets of crime, when they are victimized the impact of each vicious attack has long-lasting effects. Injuries involving, for example, a broken hip may never heal properly and often leave the victim physically impaired. The loss of money used for food and other daily living expenses for these costs may be life-threatening for the older citizen on a fixed income. In addition, stolen or damaged property often cannot be replaced.

(5) Although the State of California currently funds programs to provide assistance to victims of crime and to provide general crime prevention information, there are limited specialized efforts to respond directly to the needs of elderly victims or to provide prevention services tailored for the senior population.

(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that victim services, crime prevention, and criminal justice training programs funded by the Office of Emergency Services shall include, consistent with available resources, specialized components that respond to the diverse needs of elderly citizens residing in the state.

###### 13823.4.



(a) The Legislature finds the problem of family violence to be of serious and increasing magnitude. The Legislature also finds that acts of family violence often result in other crimes and social problems.

(b) There is in the Office of Emergency Services, a Family Violence Prevention Program. This program shall provide financial and technical assistance to local domestic and family violence centers in implementing family violence prevention programs.

The goals and functions of the program shall include all of the following:

(2) Development and dissemination of model protocols for the training of criminal justice system personnel in domestic violence intervention and prevention.

(3) Increasing citizen involvement in family violence prevention.

(4) Identification and testing of family violence prevention models.

(5) Replication of successful models, as appropriate, through the state.

(6) Identification and testing of domestic violence model protocols and intervention systems in major service delivery institutions.

(7) Development of informational materials and seminars to enable emulation or adaptation of the models by other communities.

(8) Provision of domestic violence prevention education and skills to students in schools.

(c) The Director of Emergency Services shall allocate funds to local centers meeting the criteria for funding that shall be established by the Office of Emergency Services in consultation with practitioners and experts in the field of family violence prevention. All centers receiving funds pursuant to this section shall have had an ongoing recognized program, supported by either public or private funds, dealing with an aspect of family violence, for at least two years prior to the date specified for submission of applications for funding pursuant to this section. All centers funded pursuant to this section shall utilize volunteers to the greatest extent possible.

The centers may seek, receive, and make use of any funds which may be available from all public and private sources to augment any state funds received pursuant to this section. Sixty percent of the state funds received pursuant to this section shall be used to develop and implement model program protocols and materials. Forty percent of the state funds received pursuant to this section shall be allocated to programs to disseminate model program protocols and materials. Dissemination shall include training for domestic violence agencies in California. Each of the programs funded under this section shall focus on no more than two targeted areas. These targeted model areas shall be determined by the Office of Emergency Services in consultation with practitioners and experts in the field of domestic violence, using the domestic violence model priorities survey of the California Alliance Against Domestic Violence.

Centers receiving funding shall provide matching funds of at least 10 percent of the funds received pursuant to this section.

(d) The Office of Emergency Services shall develop and disseminate throughout the state information and materials concerning family violence prevention, including, but not limited to, a procedures manual on prevention models. The Office of Emergency Services shall also establish a resource center for the collection, retention, and distribution of educational materials related to family violence and its prevention.

(C) For DVSSPs reapplying for funding under the request for application process described in paragraph (4), a system for grading the performance of DVSSPs in relation to the standards established pursuant to subparagraph (A), and an appeal process for decisions to deny or reduce funding. A description of this grading system and appeal process shall be provided to all DVSSPs receiving grants under this program.

(2) Grants for shelters that were not funded in the previous cycle shall be awarded as a result of a competitive request for proposal (RFP) process. The RFP process shall comply with all applicable state and federal statutes for domestic violence shelter funding and, to the extent possible, the response to the RFP shall not exceed 25 narrative pages, excluding attachments.

(6) The Office of Emergency Services shall conduct a minimum of one site visit every three years for each DVSSP funded pursuant to this subdivision. The purpose of the site visit shall be to conduct a performance assessment of, and provide subsequent technical assistance for, each shelter visited.

The Office of Emergency Services shall also develop a corrective action plan for verifying the completion of corrective action required. The Office of Emergency Services shall submit its written report to the DVSSP no more than 60 days after the site visit. No grant under the RFA process shall be denied if the DVSSP has not received a site visit during the previous three years, unless the Office of Emergency Services is aware of criminal violations relative to the administration of grant funding.

(8) If an agency receives funding from both the Comprehensive Statewide Domestic Violence Program in the Office of Emergency Services and the Maternal, Child, and Adolescent Health Division of the State Department of Public Health during any grant cycle, the Comprehensive Statewide Domestic Violence Program and the Maternal, Child, and Adolescent Health Division shall, to the extent feasible, coordinate agency site visits and share performance assessment data with the goal of improving efficiency, eliminating duplication, and reducing administrative costs.

(9) DVSSPs receiving written reports of deficiencies or orders for corrective action after a site visit shall be given no less than six months’ time to take corrective action before the deficiencies or failure to correct may be considered in the next RFA process. However, the Office of Emergency Services shall have the discretion to reduce the time to take corrective action in cases where the deficiencies present a significant health or safety risk or when other severe circumstances are found to exist. If corrective action is deemed necessary, and a DVSSP fails to comply, or if other deficiencies exist that, in the judgment of the Office of Emergency Services, cannot be corrected, the Office of Emergency Services shall determine, using its grading system, whether continued funding for the DVSSP should be reduced or denied altogether. If a DVSSP has been determined to be deficient, the Office of Emergency Services may, at any point during the DVSSP’s funding cycle following the expiration of the period for corrective action, deny or reduce further funding.

(10) If a DVSSP applies or reapplies for funding pursuant to this section and that funding is denied or reduced, the decision to deny or reduce funding shall be provided in writing to the DVSSP, along with a written explanation of the reasons for the reduction or denial made in accordance with the grading system for the RFP or RFA process. Except as otherwise provided, an appeal of the decision to deny or reduce funding shall be made in accordance with the appeal process established by the Office of Emergency Services. The appeal process shall allow a DVSSP a minimum of 30 days to appeal after a decision to deny or reduce funding. All pending appeals shall be resolved before final funding decisions are reached.

(11) It is the intent of the Legislature that priority for additional funds that become available shall be given to currently funded, new, or previously unfunded DVSSPs for expansion of services. However, the Office of Emergency Services may determine when expansion is needed to accommodate underserved or unserved areas. If supplemental funding is unavailable, the Office of Emergency Services shall have the authority to lower the base level of grants to all currently funded DVSSPs in order to provide funding for currently funded, new, or previously unfunded DVSSPs that will provide services in underserved or unserved areas. However, to the extent reasonable, funding reductions shall be reduced proportionately among all currently funded DVSSPs. After the amount of funding reductions has been determined, DVSSPs that are currently funded and those applying for funding shall be notified of changes in the available level of funding prior to the next application process. Funding reductions made under this paragraph shall not be subject to appeal.

(12) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Office of Emergency Services may reduce funding to a DVSSP funded pursuant to this section if federal funding support is reduced. Funding reductions as a result of a reduction in federal funding shall not be subject to appeal.

The minimum training specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 1037.1 of the Evidence Code shall be provided to those staff and volunteers who do not meet the requirements of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 1037.1 of the Evidence Code.

(15) The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this subdivision:

###### 13826.



The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) That violent activity by gangs is a serious and growing problem in the State of California.

(b) There is an increasing percentage of school age pupils involved in gang activity.

(c) There are many schools that serve a disproportionate number of youth involved in gang activity which are unable to effectively implement programs designed to prevent youth from becoming involved in gang activity. There is no statewide funded educational program developed for this purpose.

(d) There is evidence that gang involvement among youth begins at an early age.

(e) There is evidence that the parents of gang members lack appropriate parenting skills.

(f) There is evidence that drug activity is increasing among youth involved in gang activity.

(g) There is evidence that gang members have no contact with positive role models.

(h) There is evidence that most gang members lack basic educational skills.

In enacting this chapter, the Legislature intends to support increased efforts by district attorneys’ offices to prosecute the perpetrators of gang violence, support increased efforts by local law enforcement agencies to identify, investigate, and apprehend perpetrators of gang violence, support increased efforts by county probation departments to intensively supervise gang members who are on court-ordered probation, support gang violence prevention and intervention efforts by school districts and county offices of education, and support gang violence suppression efforts by community-based organizations.

_(Repealed and added by Stats. 1986, Ch. 929, Sec. 2.)_

###### 13826.1.



(a) There is hereby established in the Board of State and Community Corrections, the Gang Violence Suppression Program, a program of financial and technical assistance for district attorneys’ offices, local law enforcement agencies, county probation departments, school districts, county offices of education, or any consortium thereof, and community-based organizations which are primarily engaged in the suppression of gang violence.

(b) Funds made available pursuant to this chapter are intended to ensure the highest quality provision of services and to reduce unnecessary duplication. Funds disbursed under this chapter shall not be used by local agencies to supplant other funding for Public Safety Services, as defined in Section 36 of Article XIII of the California Constitution. Funds awarded under this program as local assistance grants shall not be subject to review as specified in Section 10295 of the Public Contract Code.

###### 13826.11.



(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:

(1) There is a greater threat to public safety resulting from gang- and drug-related activity in and near California’s inner cities.

(2) Young people, especially at-promise youth, are more vulnerable to gang- and drug-related activity during the potentially unsupervised hours between the end of school and the time their parents or guardians return home from work.

(3) Without local prevention and treatment efforts, hard drugs will continue to threaten and destroy families and communities in and near the inner cities. Drug-related violence may then escalate dramatically in every community, and thereby burden the criminal justice system to the point that it cannot function effectively.

(4) Los Angeles currently leads the nation in the number of gang members and gang sites, the consumption of drugs, the amount of drugs confiscated, drug-related violent crimes, and has the greatest number of young people between 6 and 18 years of age who are “at risk.”

(5) It is the intent of the Legislature that a pilot program, the “After School Alternative Program” (ASAP), be established and implemented within a specified Los Angeles community. This community program would utilize the public schools, businesses, and community facilities to provide supportive programs and activities to young people during the time between the end of school and the return home of their parents or guardians (from approximately 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.).

(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the implementation of the Gang Violence Suppression Program, as provided in this chapter, has made a positive impact in the battle against crimes committed by gang members in California.

(b) The Legislature further finds and declares that the program, when it was originally created in 1981, provided financial and technical assistance only for district attorneys’ offices. Since that time, however, the provisions of the program have been amended by the Legislature to enable additional public entities and community-based organizations to participate in the program.

\


###### 13830.



There is hereby created in state government a Judicial Criminal Justice Planning Committee of seven members. The Judicial Council shall appoint the members of the committee who shall hold office at its pleasure. In this respect the Legislature finds as follows:

(a) The California court system has a constitutionally established independence under the judicial and separation of power clauses of the State Constitution.

(b) The California court system has a statewide structure created under the Constitution, state statutes, and state court rules, and the Judicial Council of California is the constitutionally established state agency having responsibility for the operation of that structure.

(c) The California court system will be directly affected by the criminal justice planning that will be done under this title and by the federal grants that will be made to implement that planning.

(d) For effective planning and implementation of court projects it is essential that the Office of Emergency Services have the advice and assistance of a state judicial system planning committee.

_(Amended by Stats. 2013, Ch. 352, Sec. 443. (AB 1317) Effective September 26, 2013. Operative July 1, 2013, by Sec. 543 of Ch. 352.)_

_( Article 2 repealed and added by Stats. 1983, Ch. 1312, Sec. 2. )_

\


###### 13835.



The Legislature finds and declares as follows:

(a) That there is a need to develop methods to reduce the trauma and insensitive treatment that victims and witnesses may experience in the wake of a crime, since all too often citizens who become involved with the criminal justice system, either as victims or witnesses to crime, are further victimized by that system.

(b) That when a crime is committed, the chief concern of criminal justice agencies has been apprehending and dealing with the criminal, and that after police leave the scene of the crime, the victim is frequently forgotten.

(c) That victims often become isolated and receive little practical advice or necessary care.

(d) That witnesses must make arrangements to appear in court regardless of their own schedules, child care responsibilities, or transportation problems, and that they often find long waits, crowded courthouse hallways, confusing circumstances and, after testifying, receive no information as to the disposition of the case.

(e) That a large number of victims and witnesses are unaware of both their rights and obligations.

(f) That although the State of California has a fund for needy victims of violent crimes, and compensation is available for medical expenses, lost income or wages, and rehabilitation costs, the application process may be difficult, complex, and time-consuming, and victims may not be aware that the compensation provisions exist.

It is, therefore, the intent of the Legislature to provide services to meet the needs of both victims and witnesses of crime through the funding of local comprehensive centers for victim and witness assistance.

_(Repealed and added by Stats. 1983, Ch. 1312, Sec. 2.)_

###### 13835.2.

(1) It provides comprehensive services to victims and witnesses of all types of crime. It is the intent of the Legislature to make funds available only to programs that do not restrict services to victims and witnesses of a particular type of crime, and do not restrict services to victims of crime in which there is a suspect in the case.

(2) It is recognized by the board of supervisors as the major provider of comprehensive services to victims and witnesses in the county.

(3) It is selected by the board of supervisors as the agency to receive funds pursuant to this article.

###### 13835.7.



There is in the State Treasury the Victim-Witness Assistance Fund. Funds appropriated thereto shall be dispensed to the Office of Emergency Services exclusively for the purposes specified in this article, for any other purpose that supports victims, and for the support of the centers specified in Section 13837.

_(Amended by Stats. 2014, Ch. 28, Sec. 74. (SB 854) Effective June 20, 2014.)_

###### 13835.10.



(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) That the provision of quality services for victims of crime is of high priority.

(2) That existing victim service programs do not have sufficient financial resources to consistently recruit and employ fully trained personnel.

(3) That there is no consistency in the training provided to the various agencies serving victims.

(4) That comprehensive training for victim service agencies is geographically limited or unavailable.

(5) That there is currently no statewide comprehensive training system in place for the state to ensure that all service providers receive adequate training to provide quality services to victims of crime.

(6) It is the intention of the Legislature to establish a statewide training program within the Office of Emergency Services to provide comprehensive standardized training to victim service providers.

(b) The Office of Emergency Services shall establish a statewide victim-assistance training program, the purpose of which is to develop minimum training and selection standards, certify training courses, and provide funding to enable local victim service providers to acquire the required training.

(c)(1) For the purpose of raising the level of competence of local victim service providers, the Office of Emergency Services shall adopt guidelines establishing minimum standards of training for employees of victim-witness and sexual assault programs funded by the office to provide services to victims of crime. The Office of Emergency Services shall establish an advisory committee composed of recognized statewide victim service organizations, representatives of local victim service programs, and others selected at the discretion of the executive director to consult on the research and development of the training, selection, and equivalency standards.

(2) Any local unit of government, community-based organization, or any other public or private nonprofit entity funded by the Office of Emergency Services as a victim-witness or sexual assault program to provide services to victims of crime shall adhere to the training and selection standards established by the Office of Emergency Services. The standards for sexual assault victim service programs developed by the advisory committee established pursuant to Section 13836 shall be the standards for purposes of this section. With the exception of the sexual assault standards, the Office of Emergency Services shall conduct or contract with an appropriate firm or entity for research on validated standards pursuant to this section in consultation with the advisory committee established pursuant to paragraph (1). The Office of Emergency Services may defer the adoption of the selection standards until the necessary research is completed. Until the standards are adopted, affected victim service programs may receive state funding from the Office of Emergency Services upon certification of their willingness to adhere to the training standards adopted by the Office of Emergency Services.

(3) Minimum training and selection standards may include, but shall not be limited to, basic entry, continuation, supervisory, management, specialized curricula, and confidentiality.

(4) Training and selection standards shall apply to all victim service and management personnel of the victim-witness and sexual assault agencies funded by the Office of Emergency Services to provide services to victims of crime. Exemptions from this requirement may be made by the Office of Emergency Services. A victim service agency which, despite good faith efforts, is unable to meet the standards established pursuant to this section, may apply to the Office of Emergency Services for an exemption. For the purpose of exemptions, the Office of Emergency Services may establish procedures that allow for partial adherence. The Office of Emergency Services may develop equivalency standards which recognize professional experience, education, training, or a combination of the above, for personnel hired before July 1, 1987.

(5) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a victim service agency, funded by the Office of Emergency Services to provide services to victims of crime, from establishing training and selection standards which exceed the minimum standards established by the Office of Emergency Services pursuant to this section.

(d) For purposes of implementing this section, the Office of Emergency Services has all of the following powers:

(1) To approve or certify, or both, training courses selected by the agency.

(2) To make those inquiries which may be necessary to determine whether every local unit of government, community-based organization, or any other public or private entity receiving state aid from the Office of Emergency Services as a victim-witness or sexual assault program for the provision of services to victims of crime, is adhering to the standards for training and selection established pursuant to this section.

(3) To adopt those guidelines which are necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.

(4) To develop or present, or both, training courses for victim service providers, or to contract with coalitions, councils, or other designated entities, to develop or present, or both, those training courses.

(5) To perform other activities and studies necessary to carry out the intent of this section.

(e) (1) The Office of Emergency Services may utilize any funds that may become available from the Victim-Witness Assistance Fund to fund the cost of training staff of victim service agencies which are funded by the Office of Emergency Services from the fund. The Office of Emergency Services may utilize federal or other state funds that may become available to fund the cost of training staff of victim service agencies which are not eligible for funding from the Victim-Witness Assistance Fund.

(2) Peace officer personnel whose jurisdictions are eligible for training subvention pursuant to Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 13500) of Title 4 of this part and correctional or probation personnel whose jurisdictions are eligible for state aid pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 6035) of Chapter 5 of Title 7 of Part 3 are not eligible to receive training reimbursements under this section unless the person receiving the training is assigned to provide victim services in accordance with a grant award agreement with the Office of Emergency Services and is attending training to meet the established standards.

The RFA process shall comply with all applicable state and federal statutes for sexual assault/rape crisis center funding, and to the extent possible, the response to the RFA shall not exceed 10 narrative pages, excluding attachments.

(E) Any SASP funded through this program in the previous grant cycle shall be funded upon reapplication, unless its past performance history fails to meet the standards established pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph (A).

(F) The Cal OES shall conduct a minimum of one site visit every three years for each agency funded to provide sexual assault/rape crisis centers. The purpose of the site visit shall be to conduct a performance assessment of, and provide subsequent technical assistance for, each center visited. The performance assessment shall include, but need not be limited to, a review of all of the following:

(i) Progress in meeting program goals and objectives.

(ii) Agency organization and facilities.

(iii) Personnel policies, files, and training.

(iv) Recordkeeping, budgeting, and expenditures.

(v) Documentation, data collection, and client confidentiality.

(G) After each site visit conducted pursuant to subparagraph (F), the Cal OES shall provide a written report to the SASP summarizing the performance of the SASP, any deficiencies noted, any corrective action needed, and a deadline for corrective action to be completed. The Cal OES shall also develop a corrective action plan for verifying the completion of corrective action required. The Cal OES shall submit its written report to the SASP no more than 60 days after the site visit. A grant under the RFA process shall not be denied if the SASP did not receive a site visit during the previous three years, unless the Cal OES is aware of criminal violations relative to the administration of grant funding.

(H) SASPs receiving written reports of deficiencies or orders for corrective action after a site visit shall be given no less than six months’ time to take corrective action before the deficiencies or failure to correct may be considered in the next RFA process. However, the Cal OES shall have the discretion to reduce the time to take corrective action in cases where the deficiencies present a significant health or safety risk or when other severe circumstances are found to exist. If corrective action is deemed necessary, and a SASP fails to comply, or if other deficiencies exist that, in the judgment of the Cal OES, cannot be corrected, the Cal OES shall determine, using its grading system, whether continued funding for the SASP should be reduced or denied altogether. If a SASP has been determined to be deficient, the Cal OES may, at any point during the SASP’s funding cycle following the expiration of the period for corrective action, deny or reduce further funding.

(I) If a SASP applies or reapplies for funding pursuant to this section and that funding is denied or reduced, the decision to deny or reduce funding shall be provided in writing to the SASP, along with a written explanation of the reasons for the reduction or denial made in accordance with the grading system for the RFP or RFA process. Except as otherwise provided, any appeal of the decision to deny or reduce funding shall be made in accordance with the appeal process established by the Cal OES. The appeal process shall allow a SASP a minimum of 30 days to appeal after a decision to deny or reduce funding. All pending appeals shall be resolved before final funding decisions are reached.

(J) It is the intent of the Legislature that priority for additional funds that become available be given to currently funded, new, or previously unfunded SASPs for expansion of services. However, the Cal OES may determine when expansion is needed to accommodate underserved or unserved areas. If supplemental funding is unavailable, the Cal OES shall have the authority to lower the base level of grants to all currently funded SASPs in order to provide funding for currently funded, new, or previously unfunded SASPs that will provide services in underserved or unserved areas. However, to the extent reasonable, funding reductions shall be reduced proportionately among all currently funded SASPs. After the amount of funding reductions has been determined, SASPs that are currently funded and those applying for funding shall be notified of changes in the available level of funding prior to the next application process. Funding reductions made under this paragraph shall not be subject to appeal.

(K) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Cal OES may reduce funding to a SASP funded pursuant to this section if federal funding support is reduced. Funding reductions as a result of a reduction in federal funding are not subject to appeal.

(L) This section shall not be construed to supersede any function or duty required by federal acts, rules, regulations, or guidelines for the distribution of federal grants.

(M) As a condition of receiving funding pursuant to this section, a SASP shall do each of the following:

(i) Demonstrate an ability to receive and make use of any funds available from governmental, voluntary, philanthropic, or other sources that may be used to augment any state funds appropriated for purposes of this chapter.

(ii) Make every attempt to qualify for any available federal funding.

(N) For the purposes of this paragraph, “sexual assault” means an act or attempt made punishable by Section 220, 261, 261.5, 264.1, 266c, 285, 286, 287, 288, or 647.6, or former Section 262 or 288a.

(O) For the purposes of this paragraph, “sexual assault services program” or “SASP” means an agency operating a sexual assault/rape crisis center.

(c) Any regional task force receiving funds under this section may elect to have the Department of Justice administer the regional task force program. The department may be reimbursed for any expenditures incurred for administering a regional task force from funds given to local law enforcement pursuant to subdivision (b).

The Legislature hereby finds that a substantial and disproportionate amount of serious crime is committed against the people of California by a relatively small number of multiple and repeat felony offenders, commonly known as career criminals. In enacting this chapter, the Legislature intends to support increased efforts by local law enforcement agencies to investigate and apprehend career criminals through management, organization and operational techniques that have been demonstrated to be effective in selected cities and counties in this and other states, and through advanced state-of-the-art techniques that focus law enforcement efforts and resources on identifying persons subject to career criminal apprehension efforts.

_(Amended by Stats. 1985, Ch. 477, Sec. 1.)_

###### 13851.



(a) There is hereby established in the Office of Emergency Services a program of financial, training, and technical assistance for local law enforcement, called the California Career Criminal Apprehension Program. All funds made available to the Office of Emergency Services for the purposes of this chapter shall be administered and disbursed by the Director of Emergency Services.

(b) The Director of Emergency Services is authorized to allocate and award funds to those local units of government or combinations thereof, in which a special program is established in law enforcement agencies that meets the criteria set forth in Sections 13852 and 13853.

(c) The allocation and award of funds shall be made upon application executed by the chief law enforcement officer of the applicant unit of government and approved by the legislative body.

###### 13864.



There is hereby created in the Office of Emergency Services the Comprehensive Alcohol and Drug Prevention Education component of the Suppression of Drug Abuse in Schools Program in public elementary schools in grades 4 to 6, inclusive. Notwithstanding Section 13861 or any other provision in this code, all Comprehensive Alcohol and Drug Prevention Education component funds made available to the Office of Emergency Services in accordance with the Classroom Instructional Improvement and Accountability Act shall be administered by and disbursed to county superintendents of schools in this state by the Director of Emergency Services. All applications for that funding shall be reviewed and evaluated by the Office of Emergency Services, in consultation with the State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Education.

(a) The Director of Emergency Services is authorized to allocate and award funds to county department superintendents of schools for allocation to individual school districts or to a consortium of two or more school districts. Applications funded under this section shall comply with the criteria, policies, and procedures established under subdivision (b) of this section.

(b) As a condition of eligibility for the funding described in this section, the school district or consortium of school districts shall have entered into an agreement with a local law enforcement agency to jointly implement a comprehensive alcohol and drug abuse prevention, intervention, and suppression program developed by the Office of Emergency Services, in consultation with the State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Education, containing all of the following components:

(1) A standardized age-appropriate curriculum designed for pupils in grades 4 to 6, inclusive, specifically tailored and sensitive to the socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics of the target pupil population. Although new curricula shall not be required to be developed, existing curricula may be modified and adapted to meet local needs. The elements of the standardized comprehensive alcohol and drug prevention education program curriculum shall be defined and approved by the Governor’s Policy Council on Drug and Alcohol Abuse, as established by Executive Order No. D-70-80.

(2) A planning process that includes assessment of the school district’s characteristics, resources, and the extent of problems related to juvenile drug abuse, and input from local law enforcement agencies.

(3) A school district governing board policy that provides for a coordinated intervention system that, at a minimum, includes procedures for identification, intervention, and referral of at-promise alcohol- and drug-involved youth, and identifies the roles and responsibilities of law enforcement, school personnel, parents, and pupils.

(4) Early intervention activities that include, but are not limited to, the identification of pupils who are high risk or have chronic drug abuse problems, assessment, and referral for appropriate services, including ongoing support services.

(5) Parent education programs to initiate and maintain parental involvement, with an emphasis for parents of at-risk pupils.

(6) Staff and in-service training programs, including both indepth training for the core team involved in providing program services and general awareness training for all school faculty and administrative, credentialed, and noncredentialed school personnel.

(7) In-service training programs for local law enforcement officers.

(8) School, law enforcement, and community involvement to ensure coordination of program services. Pursuant to that coordination, the school district or districts and other local agencies are encouraged to use a single community advisory committee or task force for drug, alcohol, and tobacco abuse prevention programs, as an alternative to the creation of a separate group for that purpose under each state or federally funded program.

(c) The application of the county superintendent of schools shall be submitted to the Office of Emergency Services. Funds made available to the Office of Emergency Services for allocation under this section are intended to enhance, but shall not supplant, local funds that would, in the absence of the Comprehensive Alcohol and Drug Prevention Education component, be made available to prevent, intervene in, or suppress drug abuse among schoolage children. For districts that are already implementing a comprehensive drug abuse prevention program for pupils in grades 4 to 6, inclusive, the county superintendent shall propose the use of the funds for drug prevention activities in school grades other than 4 to 6, inclusive, compatible with the program components of this section. The expenditure of funds for that alternative purpose shall be approved by the Director of Emergency Services.

(1) Unless otherwise authorized by the Office of Emergency Services, each county superintendent of schools shall be the fiscal agent for any Comprehensive Alcohol and Drug Prevention Education component award, and shall be responsible for ensuring that each school district within that county receives the allocation prescribed by the Office of Emergency Services. Each county superintendent shall develop a countywide plan that complies with program guidelines and procedures established by the Office of Emergency Services pursuant to subdivision (d). A maximum of 5 percent of the county’s allocation may be used for administrative costs associated with the project.

(2) Each county superintendent of schools shall establish and chair a local coordinating committee to assist the superintendent in developing and implementing a countywide implementation plan. This committee shall include the county drug administrator, law enforcement executives, school district governing board members and administrators, school faculty, parents, and drug prevention and intervention program executives selected by the superintendent and approved by the county board of supervisors.

(d) The Director of Emergency Services, in consultation with the State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Education, shall prepare and issue guidelines and procedures for the Comprehensive Alcohol and Drug Prevention Education component consistent with this section.

(e) The Comprehensive Alcohol and Drug Prevention Education component guidelines shall set forth the terms and conditions upon which the Office of Emergency Services is prepared to award grants of funds pursuant to this section. The guidelines shall not constitute rules, regulations, orders, or standards of general application.

(f) Funds awarded under the Comprehensive Alcohol and Drug Prevention Education Program shall not be subject to Section 10318 of the Public Contract Code.

(g) Funds available pursuant to Item 8100-111-001 and Provision 1 of Item 8100-001-001 of the Budget Act of 1989, or the successor provision of the appropriate Budget Act, shall be allocated to implement this section.

(h) The Director of Emergency Services shall collaborate, to the extent possible, with other state agencies that administer drug, alcohol, and tobacco abuse prevention education programs to streamline and simplify the process whereby local educational agencies apply for drug, alcohol, and tobacco education funding under this section and under other state and federal programs. The Office of Emergency Services, the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Education, and other state agencies, to the extent possible, shall develop joint policies and collaborate planning in the administration of drug, alcohol, and tobacco abuse prevention education programs.

(a) Every law enforcement and social services agency in this state is encouraged to develop, adopt, and implement written policies and standards for their response to narcotics crime scenes where a child is either immediately present or where there is evidence that a child lives, by January 1, 2005. These policies shall reflect the fact that exposing a child to the manufacturing, trafficking, and use of narcotics is criminal conduct and that a response coordinated by law enforcement and social services agencies is essential to the child’s health and welfare.

(b) The needs of a drug endangered child are best served with written policies encouraging the arrest of an individual for child endangerment where there is probable cause that an offense has been committed coordinated with an appropriate investigation of the child’s welfare by child protective agencies. Protocols that encourage a dependency investigation contemporaneous with a law enforcement investigation at a narcotics crime scene, when appropriate, are consistent with a child’s best interest.

###### 13880.



(a) The Legislature finds and declares that the production and sale of narcotics is an ever increasing problem because of the substantial illicit profits derived therefrom. The Legislature further finds and declares that a substantial and disproportionate amount of serious crime is associated with the cultivation, processing, manufacturing, and sale of narcotics.

(b) The Legislature finds and declares that the level of production, distribution, and sale of narcotics in small counties in this state threatens the well-being not only of citizens of those counties, but of the rest of the state as well. Since many of these counties have experienced less growth in their general purpose revenues than the rest of the state, and yet are required to bear the burden of funding disproportionate criminal justice costs associated with the production, distribution, and sale of narcotics, the Legislature recognizes the need to provide financial assistance for these counties.

(c) The Legislature intends to support intensified efforts by district attorneys’ offices to prosecute drug producers and sellers through organizational and operational techniques that have been proven effective in selected jurisdictions in this and other states.

_(Amended by Stats. 1987, Ch. 306, Sec. 1.)_

(d) The director shall prepare and issue written program and administrative guidelines and procedures for the California Major Narcotic Vendors Prosecution Program consistent with this chapter, which shall be submitted to the Chairpersons of the Assembly Committee on Public Safety and the Senate Committee on Criminal Procedure. These guidelines shall permit the selection of a county for the allocation and award of funds only on a finding by the office that the county is experiencing a proportionately significant increase in major narcotic cases. Further, the guidelines shall provide for the allocation and award of funds to small county applicants, as designated by the director. The guidelines shall also provide that any funds received by a county under this chapter shall be used only for the prosecution of cases involving major narcotic dealers. For purposes of this subdivision, “small county” means a county having a population of 200,000 or less.

(b) In applying the criteria set forth in subdivision (a), a district attorney may, consistent with the provisions of subdivision (d) of Section 13881, elect to limit drug prosecution efforts to persons arrested for any one or more of the felonies listed in subdivision (a) if crime statistics demonstrate that the incidence of that felony or felonies presents a particularly serious problem in the county.

(c) In exercising the prosecutorial discretion granted by this section, the district attorney shall consider (1) the character, background, and prior criminal background of the defendant, and (2) the number and the seriousness of the offenses currently charged against the defendant.

(3) All reasonable prosecutorial efforts shall be made to reduce the time between arrest and disposition of charge against an individual selected for prosecution under the California Major Narcotic Vendors Prosecution Law.

(b) The selection criteria set forth in Section 13883 shall be adhered to for each California Major Narcotic Vendors Prosecution Law case unless, in the reasonable exercise of prosecutor’s discretion, extraordinary circumstances require the departure from those policies in order to promote the general purposes and intent of this chapter.

###### 13885.



The Legislature hereby finds that a substantial and disproportionate amount of sexual offenses are committed against the people of California by a relatively small number of multiple and repeat sex offenders. In enacting this chapter, the Legislature intends to support efforts of the criminal justice community through a focused effort by law enforcement and prosecuting agencies to identify, locate, apprehend, and prosecute sex offenders.

_( Chapter 11 added by Stats. 1985, Ch. 1443, Sec. 1. )_

\


###### 13897.



The Legislature finds and declares each of the following:

(a) The citizens of California have expressed great concern for the plight of crime victims.

(b) It is in the best interest, not only of the victims and their families, but also of all the citizens of California to ensure that crime victims receive comprehensive assistance in overcoming the effects of victimization.

(c) While many options and rights exist for the crime victim, including providing financial assistance pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 13959) of Part 4 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, participation in sentencing and parole eligibility hearings of criminal perpetrators, civil litigation against the perpetrator and third parties, assistance from victim-witness programs, and private support and counseling services, research indicates that many crime victims suffer needlessly because they are not aware of these options and rights, or are apprehensive or uncertain about where to go for assistance or how to exercise their rights.

(d) It is thus necessary to provide a resource center, statewide in scope, where victims of crime, their families, and providers of services to victims of crime can receive referral information, assistance, and legal guidance in order to deal effectively with the needs of victims of crime and minimize the continuing victimization process, which often results from a complex justice system. This resource center shall be independent, offer victims assistance in understanding and effectively exercising their legal rights, provide information about their rights and the workings of the criminal justice system, and direct them to appropriate local resources and agencies which can offer further assistance. The resource center shall provide, on a statewide basis, information assistance for all crime victims without charge and shall complement the efforts of various local programs, including victim-witness programs, rape crisis units, domestic violence projects, and child abuse centers.

_(Amended by Stats. 1988, Ch. 1640, Sec. 1.)_

###### 13897.1.



(a) There shall be established a resource center that shall provide legal and other information for crime victims, their families, and providers of services to crime victims through a statewide, toll-free telephone number and an internet website. The resource center shall provide information and educational materials discussing crime victims’ legal rights. The resource center shall distribute these materials to administrative agencies, law enforcement agencies, crime victim-service programs, local, regional, and statewide education systems, appropriate human service agencies, and political, social, civic, and religious leaders and organizations.

(b) As used in this chapter, “provider of services to crime victims” means any hospital, doctor, attorney, local or statewide rape crisis center, domestic violence center, child abuse counseling center, or victims’ witness center that seeks to assist crime victims in understanding and exercising their legal rights, including, but not limited to, those rights under Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 13959) of Part 4 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.

_(Amended by Stats. 2023, Ch. 105, Sec. 1. (SB 86) Effective January 1, 2024.)_

###### 13897.2.



(a) The Office of Emergency Services shall grant an award to an appropriate private, nonprofit organization, to provide a statewide resource center, as described in Section 13897.1.

(b) The resource center shall:

(1) Provide users with information about victims’ legal rights to compensation pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 13959) of Part 4 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code and, where appropriate, provide victims with guidance in exercising these rights.

(2) Provide users who provide services to victims of crime with legal information regarding the legal rights of crime victims.

(3) Advise users about any potential civil causes of action and, where appropriate, provide callers with references to local legal aid and lawyer referral services.

(4) Advise and assist users in understanding and implementing their rights to participate in sentencing and parole eligibility hearings as provided by statute.

(5) Advise users about victims’ rights in the criminal justice system, assist them in overcoming problems, including the return of property, and inform them of any procedures protecting witnesses.

(6) Refer users, as appropriate, to local programs, which include victim-witness programs, rape crisis units, domestic violence projects, and child sexual abuse centers.

(7) Refer users to local resources for information about appropriate public and private benefits and the means of obtaining aid.

(8) Publicize the existence of the toll-free service and internet website through the print and electronic media, including public service announcements, brochures, press announcements, various other educational materials, and agreements for the provision of publicity, by private entities.

(9) Compile comprehensive referral lists of local resources that include the following: crime victims’ assistance resources, including legal and medical services, financial assistance, personal counseling and support services, and crime victims’ support groups.

(10) Produce promotional materials for distribution to law enforcement agencies, state and local agencies, print, radio, and television media outlets, and the general public. These materials shall include placards, video and audio training materials, written handbooks, and brochures for public distribution. Distribution of these materials shall be coordinated with the local crime victims’ service programs.

(11) Research, compile, and maintain a library of legal information concerning crime victims and their rights.

(12) Provide a 20-percent-minimum cash match for all funds appropriated pursuant to this chapter, which may include federal and private funds in order to supplement any funds appropriated by the Legislature.

(c) The resource center shall be located so as to assure convenient and regular access between the resource center and those state agencies most concerned with crime victims. The entity receiving the grant shall be a private, nonprofit organization, independent of law enforcement agencies, and have qualified staff knowledgeable in the legal rights of crime victims and the programs and services available to crime victims throughout the state. The subgrantee shall have an existing statewide, toll-free information service and internet website and have demonstrated substantial capacity and experience serving crime victims in areas required by this act.

(d) The internet website maintained pursuant to this section shall include a summary of crime victims’ rights and resources in plain language, including, but not limited to:

(1) Information about victims’ rights, including the disclosures required under Section 679.026 and the information required by paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 679.027.

(2) Links to victim resources offered by the state and by each county.

(3) Additional links or resources from public or private entities that the center determines are relevant and appropriate.

(4) A summary of the California criminal justice process.

(5) Information on obtaining restitution from the California Victim Compensation Board.

(6) Information on obtaining legal protections for victims and their families.

(e) The services of the resource center shall not duplicate the victim service activities of the Office of Emergency Services or those activities of local victim programs funded through the Office of Emergency Services.

(f) The subgrantee shall be compensated at its federally approved indirect cost rate, if any. For the purposes of this section, “federally approved indirect cost rate” means that rate established by the federal Department of Health and Human Services or other federal agency for the subgrantee. This section does not require the Office of Emergency Services to permit the use of federally approved indirect cost rates for other subgrantees of other grants administered by the Office of Emergency Services.

(g) All information and records retained by the center in the course of providing services under this chapter shall be confidential and privileged pursuant to Article 3 (commencing with Section 950) of Chapter 4 of Division 8 of the Evidence Code and Article 4 (commencing with Section 6060) of Chapter 4 of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code. Nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit compilation and distribution of statistical data by the center.

_(Amended by Stats. 2023, Ch. 105, Sec. 2. (SB 86) Effective January 1, 2024.)_

###### 13897.3.

The Legislature finds and declares:

(a) That crime is a local problem that must be dealt with by state and local governments if it is to be controlled effectively.

(a) For the purposes of coordinating local criminal justice activities and planning for the use of state and federal action funds made available through any grant programs, criminal justice and delinquency prevention planning districts shall be established.

(b) On January 1, 1976, all planning district boundaries shall remain as they were immediately prior to that date. Thereafter, the number and boundaries of those planning districts may be altered from time to time pursuant to this section; provided that no county shall be divided into two or more districts, nor shall two or more counties which do not comprise a contiguous area form a single district.

(c) Prior to taking any action to alter the boundaries of any planning district, the council shall adopt a resolution indicating its intention to take the action and, at least 90 days prior to the taking of the action, shall forward a copy of the resolution to all units of government directly affected by the proposed action.

Each county placed within a single county planning district may constitute a planning district upon execution of a joint powers agreement or arrangement acceptable to the county and to at least that one-half of the cities in the district which contain at least one-half of the population of the district. Counties placed within a multicounty planning district may constitute a planning district upon execution of a joint powers agreement or other arrangement acceptable to the participating counties and to at least that one-half of the cities in such district which contain at least one-half of the population of such district.

(b) The California Council on Criminal Justice shall promulgate standards to ensure that the composition of each board complies with subdivision (a). The council shall annually review the composition of each board, and if it finds that the composition of a local board complies with the standards, it shall so certify. Certification shall be effective for one year; provided that if the membership of a board changes by more than 25 percent during a period of certification, the council may withdraw the certificate prior to its expiration.

(c) If the council determines that the composition of a local board does not comply with the standards, it shall direct the appropriate appointing authority to reappoint the local board and shall again review the composition pursuant to this section after such reappointments are made. The council may void decisions made by such board after such finding and due notice.

_( Title 10 added by Stats. 1984, Ch. 1709, Sec. 1. )_

\


###### 14110.



The Legislature finds the following:

(a) The incidence of violence in our state continues to present an increasing and dominating societal problem that must be addressed at its root causes in order to reduce significantly its effects upon our society.

(b) As an initial step toward that goal, the Legislature passed Assembly Bill No. 23 of the 1979–80 Regular Session which created the California Commission on Crime Control and Violence Prevention which was charged with compiling the latest research on root causes of violence, in order to lay the foundation for a credible, effective violence eradication program.

(c) The commission produced a final report in 1982 entitled “Ounces of Prevention,” which established that long-term prevention is a valuable and viable public policy and demonstrated that there are reachable root causes of violence in our society.

(d) The report contains comprehensive findings and recommendations in 10 broad categorical areas for the removal of individual, familial, and societal causal factors of crime and violence in California.

(e) The recommendations in the report are feasible and credible, propose an effective means of resolving conflict and removing the root causes of violence in our society, and should be implemented, so that their value may be provided to our citizenry.

_(Added by Stats. 1984, Ch. 1709, Sec. 1.)_

###### 14111.



The Legislature further finds that:

(a) It is in the public interest to translate the findings of the California Commission on Crime Control and Violence Prevention into community-empowering, community-activated violence prevention efforts that would educate, inspire, and inform the citizens of California about, coordinate existing programs relating to, and provide direct services addressing the root causes of, violence in California.

(b) The recommendations in the report of the commission can serve as both the foundation and guidelines for short-, intermediate-, and long-term programs to address and alleviate violence in California.

(c) It is in the public interest to facilitate the highest degree of coordination between, cooperation among, and utilization of public, nonprofit, and private sector resources, programs, agencies, organizations, and institutions toward maximally successful violence prevention and crime control efforts.

(d) Prevention is a sound fiscal, as well as social, policy objective. Crime and violence prevention programs can and should yield substantially beneficial results with regard to the exorbitant costs of both violence and crime to the public and private sectors.

(e) The Office of Emergency Services is the appropriate state agency to contract for programs addressing the root causes of violence.

_(Amended by Stats. 2013, Ch. 352, Sec. 464. (AB 1317) Effective September 26, 2013. Operative July 1, 2013, by Sec. 543 of Ch. 352.)_

(a) The California Violence Intervention and Prevention Grant Program (CalVIP) is hereby created to be administered by the Board of State and Community Corrections.

(b) The purpose of CalVIP is to improve public health and safety by supporting effective community gun violence reduction initiatives in communities that are disproportionately impacted by community gun violence. For purposes of this section, “community gun violence” means intentional acts of interpersonal violence involving a firearm, generally committed in public areas by individuals who are not intimately related to the victim, and which result in physical injury, emotional harm, or death.

(c) CalVIP grants shall be used to develop, support, expand, and replicate evidence-based community gun violence reduction initiatives, including, without limitation, hospital-based violence intervention programs, evidence-based street outreach programs, and focused deterrence strategies, that seek to interrupt cycles of community gun violence and retaliation in order to reduce the incidence of homicides, shootings, and aggravated assaults. These initiatives shall be primarily focused on providing violence intervention services to the small segment of the population that is identified as high risk of perpetrating or being victimized by community gun violence in the near future.

(d) CalVIP grants shall be made on a competitive basis to cities that are disproportionately impacted by community gun violence, to community-based organizations that serve the residents of those cities, and to counties that have one or more cities disproportionately impacted by community gun violence within their jurisdiction. For purposes of this section, “cities” includes tribal governments.

(e) For purposes of this section, a city is disproportionately impacted by community gun violence if any of the following are true:

(1) The city experienced 20 or more homicides per calendar year during two or more of the three calendar years immediately preceding the grant application for which the Department of Justice has available data.

(2) The city experienced 10 or more homicides per calendar year and had a homicide rate that was at least 50 percent higher than the statewide homicide rate during two or more of the three calendar years immediately preceding the grant application for which the Department of Justice has available data.

(3) An applicant otherwise demonstrates a unique and compelling need for additional resources to address the impact of community gun violence in the applicant’s community. Recognizing the historical challenges that California tribes have faced in gathering formal data on violent crime, the Board of State and Community Corrections shall take input from tribal governments on how to determine “compelling need,” in the context of tribal governments.

(f) An applicant for a CalVIP grant shall submit a proposal, in a form prescribed by the board, which shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:

(1) Clearly defined and measurable objectives for the grant.

(2) A statement describing how the applicant proposes to use the grant to implement an evidence-based community gun violence reduction initiative in accordance with this section, including how the applicant will identify, engage, and provide violence intervention services to individuals at high risk of perpetrating or being victimized by community gun violence in the near future.

(3) A statement describing how the applicant proposes to use the grant to enhance coordination of existing community gun violence prevention and intervention programs and minimize duplication of services in the proposed service area. Where relevant, this shall include a description of efforts to coordinate with tribal governments located near or within the planned service delivery area.

(4) Evidence indicating that the proposed violence reduction initiative would likely reduce the incidence of community gun violence in the proposed service area within the grant period.

(5) For city or county applicants, a statement demonstrating support for the proposed violence reduction initiative from one or more community-based organizations, or from a public agency or department other than a law enforcement agency that is primarily dedicated to community safety or violence prevention.

(g) In awarding CalVIP grants, the board shall give preference to applicants whose grant proposals demonstrate the greatest likelihood of reducing the incidence of community gun violence in the applicant’s community within the grant period without contributing to mass incarceration.

(h) The amount of funds awarded to an applicant shall be commensurate with the scope of the applicant’s proposal and the applicant’s demonstrated need for additional resources to address community gun violence in the applicant’s community.

(1) The Board of State and Community Corrections may award competitive grants in amounts not to exceed two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) per applicant per year. The length of the grant cycle shall be at least three years.

(2) The board shall award at least two grants to cities or counties with populations of 200,000 or less.

(i) Upon making CalVIP grant awards, the board shall make at least 20 percent of an approved grantee’s total grant award available to the grantee at the start of the grant period or as soon as possible thereafter, in order to enable grantees to immediately utilize such funds to support violence reduction initiatives.

(j) Each city or county that receives a CalVIP grant shall distribute no less than 50 percent of the grant funds to one or more of any of the following types of entities:

(1) Community-based organizations.

(2) Public agencies or departments, other than law enforcement agencies or departments, that are primarily dedicated to community safety or violence prevention.

(3) Tribal governments.

(k) The board shall form an executive steering committee including, without limitation, persons who have been impacted by community gun violence, formerly incarcerated persons, subject matter experts in community gun violence prevention and intervention, the director of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention or the director’s designee, and at least three persons with direct experience in implementing evidence-based community gun violence reduction initiatives, including initiatives that incorporate public health and community-based approaches focused on providing violence intervention services to the small segment of the population identified as high risk of perpetrating or being victimized by community gun violence in the near future.

(l) (1) The board may reserve up to two million dollars ($2,000,000) of the funds appropriated for CalVIP each year for the costs of administering and promoting the effectiveness of the program including, without limitation, the employment of personnel, providing technical assistance to grantees, coordinating with other state and local agencies on community gun violence reduction efforts, and evaluation of violence reduction initiatives supported by CalVIP.

(2) The board may, with the advice and assistance of the CalVIP executive steering committee, reserve up to 5 percent of the funds appropriated for CalVIP each year for the purpose of supporting programs and activities designed to build and sustain capacity in the field of community gun violence intervention and prevention, and to support detailed community gun violence problem analyses that help service providers and other stakeholders inform and develop community gun violence reduction initiatives by identifying individuals in their community who are at high risk of perpetrating or being victimized by community gun violence in the near future and have the highest need for violence intervention services. Activities to build and sustain capacity in the field of community-based gun violence intervention and prevention may include any of the following:

(A) Contracting with or providing grants to organizations that provide training, certification, or continued professional development to community-based gun violence intervention and prevention professionals, including frontline professionals and technical assistance providers.

(B) Contracting with or providing grants to nonprofit intermediary organizations that foster the development and growth of community-based organizations dedicated to community gun violence intervention and prevention.

(C) Providing mental health support and other supportive services to frontline community gun violence intervention professionals in order to recruit, retain, and sustain these professionals in their field.

(D) Providing mental health services or financial assistance to family members of frontline community gun violence intervention professionals who are killed or violently injured in the performance of their work.

(m) Each grantee shall report to the board, in a form and at intervals prescribed by the board, their progress in achieving the grant objectives.

(n) The board shall, by no later than 120 days following the close of each grant cycle, prepare and submit a report to the Legislature in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code regarding the impact of the violence prevention initiatives supported by CalVIP.

(o) The board shall make evaluations of CalVIP-supported initiatives available to the public.

(p) The amendments to this section made by the act that added this subdivision shall apply solely to CalVIP grant applications and awards made after January 1, 2024, and shall not be construed to affect grant applications or awards made prior to this date.

_( Heading of Title 10.6 renumbered from Title 10.5 (as added by Stats. 1992, Ch. 696) by Stats. 2001, Ch. 854, Sec. 64. )_

\


###### 14150.



The Legislature hereby finds and declares:

(a) Over the last 10 years, criminal case filings, including misdemeanor filings, have been increasing faster than any other type of filing in California’s courts. Between 1981 and 1991, nontraffic misdemeanor and infraction filings in municipal and justice courts increased by 35 percent.

(b) These misdemeanor cases add to the workload which is now straining the California court system. In addition, many of these cases are ill-suited to complete resolution through the criminal justice system because they involve underlying disputes which may result in continuing conflict and criminal conduct within the community.

(c) Many victims of misdemeanor criminal conduct feel excluded from the criminal justice process. Although they were the direct victims of the offenders’ criminal conduct, the process does not currently provide them with a direct role in holding the offender accountable for this conduct.

(d) Community conflict resolution programs utilizing alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes such as mediation and arbitration have been effectively used in California and elsewhere to resolve conflicts involving conduct that could be charged as a misdemeanor. These programs can assist in reducing the number of cases burdening the court system. By utilizing ADR processes, these programs also provide an opportunity for direct participation by the victims of the conduct, thereby increasing victims’ satisfaction with the criminal justice process. In addition, by bringing the parties together, these programs may reduce conflict within the community by facilitating the settlement of disputes which are causing repeated misdemeanor criminal conduct and may increase compliance with restitution agreements by encouraging the offender to accept personal responsibility.

(e) As of the effective date of this section, the San Francisco and Contra Costa district attorney offices refer between 1,000 and 1,500 cases per year involving conduct which could be charged as a misdemeanor to California Community Dispute Services, which provides ADR services. Between 70 and 75 percent of these cases are successfully resolved through the ADR process, and the rate of compliance with the agreements reached is between 80 and 93 percent.

(f) The State of New York has developed a substantial statewide alternative dispute resolution program in which 65 percent of the cases using the services are of a criminal nature. These cases are referred to arbitration, conciliation, and mediation. Of the criminal misdemeanor cases that were mediated, 82 percent reached an agreement through the mediation process.

(g) It is in the public interest for community dispute resolution programs to be established to provide ADR services in cases involving conduct which could be charged as a misdemeanor and for district attorneys and courts to be authorized to refer cases to these programs.

_(Added by Stats. 1992, Ch. 696, Sec. 91. Effective September 15, 1992.)_

###### 14151.



The district attorney may establish a community conflict resolution program pursuant to this title to provide alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services, such as mediation, arbitration, or a combination of both mediation and arbitration (med-arb) in cases, including those brought by a city prosecutor, involving conduct which could be charged as a misdemeanor. The district attorney may contract with a private entity to provide these services and may establish minimum training requirements for the neutral persons conducting the ADR processes.

_(Added by Stats. 1992, Ch. 696, Sec. 91. Effective September 15, 1992.)_

###### 14152.



(a) The district attorney may refer cases involving conduct which could be charged as a misdemeanor to the community conflict resolution program. In determining whether to refer a case to the community conflict resolution program, the district attorney shall consider, but is not limited to considering, all of the following:

(1) The nature of the conduct in question.

(2) The nature of the relationship between the alleged victim and the person alleged to have committed the conduct.

(3) Whether referral to the community conflict resolution program is likely to help resolve underlying issues which are likely to result in additional conduct which could be the subject of criminal charges.

(b) No case where there has been a history of child abuse, sexual assault, or domestic violence, as that term is defined in Section 6211 of the Family Code, between the alleged victim and the person alleged to have committed the conduct, or where a protective order, as defined in Section 6218 of the Family Code, is in effect, shall be referred to the community conflict resolution program.

_(Amended by Stats. 1993, Ch. 219, Sec. 222.7. Effective January 1, 1994.)_

###### 14153.



Both the alleged victim and the person alleged to have committed the conduct shall knowingly and voluntarily consent to participate in the ADR process conducted by the community conflict resolution program.

_(Added by Stats. 1992, Ch. 696, Sec. 91. Effective September 15, 1992.)_

###### 14154.



In a county in which the district attorney has established a community conflict resolution program, the superior court may, with the consent of the district attorney and the defendant, refer misdemeanor cases, including those brought by a city prosecutor, to that program. In determining whether to refer a case to the community conflict resolution program, the court shall consider, but is not limited to considering, all of the following:

(a) The factors listed in Section 14152.

(b) Any other referral criteria established by the district attorney for the program.

The court shall not refer any case to the community conflict resolution program which was previously referred to that program by the district attorney.

_(Amended by Stats. 2002, Ch. 784, Sec. 575. Effective January 1, 2003.)_

###### 14155.



(a) If the alleged victim or the person alleged to have committed the conduct does not agree to participate in the community conflict resolution program or the case is not resolved through the ADR process provided by that program, the community conflict resolution program shall promptly refer the case back to the district attorney or to the court that made the referral for appropriate action.

(b) If the community conflict resolution program determines that a case referred to it prior to the filing of a complaint has been resolved through that referral, the program shall recommend to the district attorney that the case not be prosecuted.

(c) If a case referred to the community conflict resolution program after the filing of a complaint but prior to adjudication is resolved through that referral, the court may dismiss the action pursuant to Section 1378 or 1385.

_(Added by Stats. 1992, Ch. 696, Sec. 91. Effective September 15, 1992.)_

###### 14156.



It is the intent of the Legislature that neither this title nor any other provision of law be construed to preempt other precomplaint or pretrial diversion programs. It is also the intent of the Legislature that this title not preempt other posttrial diversion programs.

_(Added by Stats. 1992, Ch. 696, Sec. 91. Effective September 15, 1992.)_

##### __TITLE 11.5. CENTRAL VALLEY RURAL CRIME PREVENTION PROGRAM \[14170 - 14174]__



_( Heading of Title 11.5 amended by Stats. 2002, Ch. 719, Sec. 1. )_

\


###### 14170.



(a) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this measure to enhance crime prevention efforts by establishing a pilot program to strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies in rural areas to detect and monitor agricultural- and rural-based crimes.

(b) The County of Tulare has developed the Rural Crime Demonstration Project administered by the Tulare County District Attorney’s office under a joint powers agreement with the Tulare County Sheriff’s office entered into pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 6500) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code.

The parties to that agreement formed a task force to include the office of the Tulare County Agricultural Commissioner. The task force is an interactive team working together to develop problem solving and crime control techniques, to encourage timely reporting of crimes, and to evaluate the results of these activities. The task force conducts joint operations in order to facilitate investigative coordination. The task force consults with experts from the United States military, the California Military Department, the Department of Justice, other law enforcement entities, and various other state and private organizations as deemed necessary to maximize the effectiveness of the task force. Media and community support have been solicited to promote the task force.

The Rural Crime Demonstration Project has proven its cost effectiveness. It is appropriate that the project be expanded into a program that will allow the County of Tulare to continue to operate the task force formed under the above described joint powers agreement, and to permit the Counties of Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, and Stanislaus to establish their own programs, pursuant to the provisions of this title, and to collectively establish a task force for the prevention of rural crime in those counties.

(c) The Legislature finds and declares that California has experienced an escalation in agricultural crimes in general, both property and personal, and that there has been no concentrated effort applied to the prevention of crimes against the agricultural industry. Currently, no national or state agency keeps track of statistics on agricultural and rural crime. According to media reports, this state lost millions of dollars worth of crops, livestock, and equipment in 1994 and 1995. A majority of these crimes occurred in agricultural-based counties. However, there has been no effort on the part of any state or local agency to accurately record these types of crimes.

The Legislature further finds and declares that there are no state or local law enforcement agencies in this state with programs that are specially designed to detect or monitor agricultural- and rural-based criminal activities. In addition, local law enforcement agencies do not possess the jurisdictional authority, investigative facilities, or data systems to coordinate a comprehensive approach to the state’s agricultural and rural crime problem.

The Legislature additionally finds and declares that the proliferation of agricultural and rural crime in the various rural counties of this state is a threat to the vitality of our rich agrarian tradition. Agricultural and rural crime, if left unchecked, endangers an entire industry that is vital to America’s continued economic role in the world, and therefore requires a proactive response from the Legislature. The intent of the Legislature in authorizing the Central Valley Rural Crime Prevention Program pursuant to this act is to provide for the protection and safety of the state’s agriculture industry by creating statewide standards and methods of detecting and tracking agrarian and rural crime.

_(Amended by Stats. 2002, Ch. 719, Sec. 2. Effective September 20, 2002.)_

###### 14171.



(a) Each of the Counties of Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare may develop within its respective jurisdiction a Central Valley Rural Crime Prevention Program, which shall be administered by the county district attorney’s office or the county sheriff’s department of each respective county under a joint powers agreement entered into pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 6500) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code.

(b) The parties to each agreement shall form a regional task force that shall be known as the Central Valley Rural Crime Task Force, that may include the respective county office of the county agricultural commissioner, the county district attorney, the county sheriff, and interested property owner groups or associations. The task force shall be an interactive team working together to develop crime prevention, problem solving, and crime control techniques, to encourage timely reporting of crimes, and to evaluate the results of these activities. The task force may operate from a joint facility in order to facilitate investigative coordination. The task force may also consult with experts from the United States military, the California Military Department, the Department of Justice, other law enforcement entities, and various other state and private organizations as deemed necessary to maximize the effectiveness of this program. Media and community support may be solicited to promote this program. Each of the participating designated counties shall adopt rules and regulations for the implementation and administration of this program.

(1) In order to receive funds for this program, each designated county shall agree to participate in a regional task force, to be known as the Central Valley Rural Crime Task Force, and shall appoint a representative to that task force.

(2) The Central Valley Rural Crime Task Force may develop rural crime prevention programs containing a system for reporting rural crimes that enables the swift recovery of stolen goods and the apprehension of criminal suspects for prosecution. The task force may develop computer software and use communication technology to implement the reporting system, although the task force is not limited to the use of these means to achieve the stated goals.

(3) The Central Valley Rural Crime Task Force may develop a uniform procedure for all participating counties to collect, and each participating county may collect, data on agricultural crimes. The task force may also establish a central database for the collection and maintenance of data on agricultural crimes and designate one participating county to maintain the database. State funds the counties receive to operate their rural crime prevention programs may be used to implement the requirements of this paragraph. This paragraph does not prohibit counties from using their own funds to implement the paragraph’s provisions, however, it is the Legislature’s intent that this paragraph shall not be construed as creating a state-mandated local program.

(c) The staff for each program may consist of the personnel designated by the district attorney and sheriff for each county in accordance with the joint powers agreement.

_(Amended by Stats. 2012, Ch. 43, Sec. 79. (SB 1023) Effective June 27, 2012.)_

_( Chapter 1 heading added by Stats. 2019, Ch. 728, Sec. 1. )_

\


###### 14230.



The Legislature finds and declares the following:

(a) Firearm violence is a significant public health and public safety problem in California and nationwide. Nationally, rates of fatal firearm violence have remained essentially unchanged for more than a decade, as declines in homicide have been offset by increases in suicide.

(b) California has been the site of some of the nation’s most infamous mass shootings, such as those at a McDonald’s in San Ysidro, at Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, near the University of California, Santa Barbara in Isla Vista, and most recently at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. Yet public mass shootings account for less than 1 percent of firearm violence. In 2014, there were 2,939 firearm-related deaths in California, including 1,582 suicides, 1,230 homicides, 89 deaths by legal intervention, and 38 unintentional or undetermined deaths. In communities where firearm violence is a frequent occurrence, the very structure of daily life is affected.

(c) Nationwide, the annual societal cost of firearm violence was estimated at $229,000,000,000 in 2012. A significant share of this burden falls on California. In 2013, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development noted that government-sponsored insurance programs covered nearly two-thirds of the costs of hospitalizations for firearm assaults in California, and about one-half of the costs of hospitalizations for unintentional injuries or those resulting from deliberate self-harm.

(d) California has been a leader in responding to this continuing crisis. However, although rates of fatal firearm violence in California are well below average for the 50 states, they are not low enough.

(e) Too little is known about firearm violence and its prevention. This is in substantial part because too little research has been done. The need for more research and more sophisticated research has repeatedly been emphasized. California’s uniquely rich data related to firearm violence have made possible important, timely, policy-relevant research that cannot be conducted elsewhere. Because there has been so little support for research, only a small number of trained investigators are available.

(f) When confronted by other major health and social problems, California and the nation have mounted effective responses, coupling an expanded research effort with policy reform in the public’s interest. Motor vehicle accidents, cancer, heart disease, and tobacco use are all examples of the benefits of this approach.

(g) Federal funding for firearm violence research through the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been virtually eliminated by Congress since 1996, leaving a major gap that must be filled by other sources.

_(Amended by Stats. 2021, Ch. 253, Sec. 4. (AB 173) Effective September 23, 2021.)_

###### 14231.



(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to establish a center for research into firearm-related violence. It is the intent of the Legislature that the center be administered by the University of California pursuant to the following principles:

(1) Interdisciplinary work of the center shall address the following:

(A) The nature of firearm violence, including individual and societal determinants of risk for involvement in firearm violence, whether as a victim or a perpetrator.

(B) The individual, community, and societal consequences of firearm violence.

(C) Prevention and treatment of firearm violence at the individual, community, and societal levels.

(2) The center shall conduct basic, translational, and transformative research with a mission to provide the scientific evidence on which sound firearm violence prevention policies and programs can be based. Its research shall include, but not be limited to, the effectiveness of existing laws and policies intended to reduce firearm violence, including the criminal misuse of firearms, and efforts to promote the responsible ownership and use of firearms.

(3) The center shall work on a continuing basis with policymakers in the Legislature and state agencies to identify, implement, and evaluate innovative firearm violence prevention policies and programs.

(4) To help ensure a long-term and successful effort to understand and prevent firearm violence, the center shall recruit and provide specialized training opportunities for new researchers, including experienced investigators in related fields who are beginning work on firearm violence, young investigators who have completed their education, postdoctoral scholars, doctoral students, and undergraduates.

(5) As a supplement to its own research, the center may administer a small grant program for research on firearm violence. All research funds shall be awarded on the basis of scientific merit as determined by an open, competitive peer review process that assures objectivity, consistency, and high quality. All qualified investigators, regardless of institutional affiliation, shall have equal access and opportunity to compete for the funds.

(6) The peer review process for the selection of grants awarded under this program shall be modeled on the process used by the National Institutes of Health in its grantmaking process.

(b) It is further the intent of the Legislature that on or before December 31, 2017, and every five years thereafter, the University of California transmit programmatic, as well as financial, reports to the state, including a report on the grants made, pending grants, program accomplishments, and the future direction of the program. The report shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.

(c) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that the center be provided with access to data kept by state agencies that is necessary for the conduct of its research.

(2) Subject to the conditions and requirements established elsewhere in statute, state agencies, including, but not limited to, the Department of Justice, the State Department of Public Health, the State Department of Health Care Services, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, and the Department of Motor Vehicles, shall provide to the center, upon proper request and following approval by the center’s governing institutional review board when required, the data necessary for the center to conduct its research.

(3) Material identifying individuals shall only be provided for research or statistical activities and shall not be transferred, revealed, or used for purposes other than research or statistical activities, and reports or publications derived therefrom shall not identify specific individuals. Recognizing the time-sensitive nature of the center’s research, data shall be provided in a timely manner. Reasonable costs to the state agency associated with the agency’s processing of that data may be billed to the center. If a request for data or letter of support for research using the data is denied, the state agency shall provide a written statement of the specific reasons for the denial.

(d) The center and all recipients of grants shall provide copies of their research publications to the Legislature and to agencies supplying data used in the conduct of that research as soon as is practicable following publication. These submissions shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.

(e) Toward these ends, the Legislature requests that the Regents of the University of California establish a Firearm Violence Research Center and administer the center and grant program pursuant to, and consistent with, the principles and goals stated herein.

(f) The center shall be named the California Firearm Violence Research Center at UC Davis.

(g) Ten thousand dollars ($10,000) is hereby appropriated from the General Fund to the Department of Justice to implement this section.

###### 14235.



The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) California experiences unacceptably high rates of firearm-related death and injury. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 3,184 gun-related deaths in California in 2017: 1,610 suicides, 1,435 homicides, 86 deaths by legal intervention, 38 unintentional deaths, and 15 deaths of undetermined type.

(b) Mass shootings are changing the character of public life in the state. Since 1982, California has experienced 19 mass shootings, resulting in 137 total deaths. On November 11, 2018, a mass shooting at a nightclub in Thousand Oaks, California, resulted in 12 deaths.

(c) In 2010, the estimated cost of hospital and emergency department care for firearm-related injuries in California was one hundred twelve million dollars ($112,000,000), with Medi-Cal and other government payers responsible for 64 percent of those costs. These high costs occur even though most people who die from firearm-related injuries do so at the scene of the shooting and receive no medical care for their injuries.

(d) Medical costs are only a small proportion (approximately 2 percent) of total societal costs, which are driven primarily by losses in productivity and quality of life.

(e) Medical and mental health care providers are uniquely positioned to help prevent all forms of firearm-related harm. Through the course of their regular patient care, they have opportunities to identify people at risk for such harm, provide evidence-based counseling on risk reduction, and intervene in situations of imminent risk.

(f) On October 30, 2018, the American College of Physicians published an updated position paper with recommendations for reducing firearm injuries and deaths in the United States that “recommends a public health approach to firearms-related violence and the prevention of firearm injuries and deaths” and encourages physicians to “discuss with their patients the risks that may be associated with having a firearm in the home and recommend ways to mitigate such risks.”

(g) Other organizations that have published statements identifying firearm-related harm as a health problem and recommending that medical and mental health professionals engage in efforts to prevent firearm-related harm as an element of their professional practice include the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the American College of Surgeons, and the American Association of Suicidology.

(h) While many medical and mental health care providers recognize their responsibility to help prevent firearm-related injury and death, many cite lack of knowledge regarding when and how to counsel patients as a principal barrier to action. A position statement adopted by the California Medical Association Board of Trustees on July 28, 2017, states that “expanded education and training are needed to improve clinician familiarity with the benefits and risks of firearm ownership, safety practices, and communication with patients about firearm violence.” The position statement further states that “medical schools and residency programs should incorporate firearm violence prevention into their academic curricula” and “California-specific resources such as continuing medical education modules, toolkits, patient education handouts, and clinical intervention information would help to address this practice gap.”

(i) Having assembled a team of experts in firearm-related death and injury, and specifically in provider and patient education to prevent firearm-related harm, the University of California Firearm Violence Research Center at UC Davis is uniquely qualified to research, develop, implement, and evaluate education and training programs for medical and mental health care providers on preventing firearm-related death and injury.

_(Added by Stats. 2019, Ch. 728, Sec. 3. (AB 521) Effective January 1, 2020.)_

###### 14236.



(a) The California Firearm Violence Research Center at UC Davis shall develop multifaceted education and training programs for medical and mental health providers on the prevention of firearm-related injury and death.

(b) The center shall develop education and training programs that address all of the following:

(1) The epidemiology of firearm-related injury and death, including the scope of the problem in California and nationwide, individual and societal determinants of risk, and effective prevention strategies for all types of firearm-related injury and death, including suicide, homicide, and unintentional injury and death.

(2) The role of health care providers in preventing firearm-related harm, including how to assess individual patients for risk of firearm-related injury and death.

(3) Best practices for conversations about firearm ownership, access, and storage.

(4) Appropriate tools for practitioner intervention with patients at risk for firearm-related injury or death, including, but not limited to, education on safer storage practices, gun violence restraining orders, and mental health interventions.

(5) Relevant laws and policies related to prevention of firearm-related injury and death and to the role of health care providers in preventing firearm-related harm.

(c) The center shall launch a comprehensive dissemination program to promote participation in these education and training programs among practicing physicians, mental health care professionals, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, health professional students, and other relevant professional groups in the state.

(d) The center shall develop curricular materials for medical and mental health care practitioners in practice and in training, tailored to the profession and suitable for use through a variety of methods. Educators from the center shall provide didactic education in person and by remote link at medical education institutions, and recruit and train additional health professionals to provide such education.

(e) The center shall develop education and training resources on firearm-related injury and death, including but not limited to, continuing medical education videos, additional training modules, a website with current information on relevant research and legislation, and handouts and written materials for clinicians to provide to patients. The center shall serve as a resource for the many professional and educational organizations in the state whose members seek to advance their knowledge of firearm-related injury and death and effective prevention measures.

(f) The center shall conduct rigorous research to further identify specific gaps in knowledge and structural barriers that prevent counseling and other interventions, and to evaluate the education and training program. The center shall incorporate the research findings into the design and implementation of the program to support the mission of the center to deliver content to health care providers and patients that is effective in guiding clinical decisions and reducing firearm-related injury and death.

The results of DNA typing shall be compatible with and uploaded into the CODIS DNA database established by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The sole purpose of this database shall be to identify missing persons and shall be kept separate from the database established under Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 295) of Title 9 of Part 1.

(3) The Department of Justice shall compare DNA samples taken from the remains of unidentified deceased persons with DNA samples taken from personal articles belonging to the missing person, or from the parents or appropriate relatives of high-risk missing persons.

(4) For the purpose of this database, “high-risk missing person” means a person missing as a result of a stranger abduction, a person missing under suspicious circumstances, a person missing under unknown circumstances, or where there is reason to assume that the person is in danger, or deceased, and that person has been missing more than 30 days, or less than 30 days in the discretion of the investigating agency.

(b) The department shall develop standards and guidelines for the preservation and storage of DNA samples. Any agency that is required to collect samples from unidentified remains for DNA testing shall follow these standards and guidelines. These guidelines shall address all scientific methods used for the identification of remains, including DNA, anthropology, odontology, and fingerprints.

(c) (1) A coroner shall collect samples for DNA testing from the remains of all unidentified persons and shall send those samples to the Department of Justice for DNA testing and inclusion in the DNA databank. After the department has taken a sample from the remains for DNA analysis and completed all DNA testing, the remaining evidence shall be returned to the appropriate local coroner.

(2) After a report has been made of a person missing under high-risk circumstances, the responsible investigating law enforcement agency shall inform the parents or other appropriate relatives that they may give a voluntary sample for DNA testing or may collect a DNA sample from a personal article belonging to the missing person if available. The samples shall be taken by the appropriate law enforcement agency in a manner prescribed by the Department of Justice. The responsible investigating law enforcement agency shall wait no longer than 30 days after a report has been made to inform the parents or other relatives of their right to give a sample.

(3) The Department of Justice shall develop a standard release form that authorizes a mother, father, or other relative to voluntarily provide the sample. The release shall explain that DNA is to be used only for the purpose of identifying the missing person and that the DNA sample and profile will be destroyed upon request. No incentive or coercion shall be used to compel a parent or relative to provide a sample.

(4) The Department of Justice shall develop a model kit that law enforcement shall use when taking samples from parents and relatives.

(5) Before submitting the sample to the department for analysis, law enforcement shall reverify the status of the missing person. After 30 days has elapsed from the date the report was filed, law enforcement shall send the sample to the department for DNA testing and inclusion in the DNA database, with a copy of the crime report, and any supplemental information.

(6) All retained samples and DNA extracted from a living person, and profiles developed therefrom, shall be used solely for the purpose of identification of the deceased’s remains. All samples and DNA extracted from a living person, and profiles developed therefrom, shall be destroyed after a positive identification with the deceased’s remains is made and a report is issued, unless any of the following has occurred:

(A) The coroner has made a report to a law enforcement agency pursuant to Section 27491.1 of the Government Code, that he or she has a reasonable ground to suspect that the identified person’s death has been occasioned by another by criminal means.

(B) A law enforcement agency makes a determination that the identified person’s death has been occasioned by another by criminal means.

(C) The evidence is needed in an active criminal investigation to determine whether the identified person’s death has been occasioned by another by criminal means.

(D) A governmental entity is required to retain the material pursuant to Section 1417.9.

(7) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, upon the request of any living person who submits his or her DNA sample and profile pursuant to this section, including the parent or guardian of a child who submits a DNA sample of the child, the DNA sample shall be removed from the DNA database.

(d) All DNA samples and profiles developed therefrom shall be confidential and shall only be disclosed to personnel of the Department of Justice, law enforcement officers, coroners, medical examiners, district attorneys, and persons who need access to a DNA sample for purposes of the prosecution or defense of a criminal case, except that a law enforcement officer or agency may publicly disclose the fact of a DNA profile match after taking reasonable measures to first notify the family of an unidentified deceased person or the family of a high-risk missing person that there has been an identification.

(e) All DNA, forensic identification profiles, and other identification information retained by the Department of Justice pursuant to this section are exempt from any law requiring disclosure of information to the public.

(f) (1) Any person who knowingly discloses DNA or other forensic identification information developed pursuant to this section to an unauthorized individual or agency, or for any purpose other than for identification or for use in a criminal investigation, prosecution, or defense, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

(2) A person who collects, processes, or stores DNA or DNA samples from a living person that are used for DNA testing pursuant to this section who does either of the following is liable in civil damages to the donor of the DNA in the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each violation, plus attorney’s fees and costs:

(A) Fails to destroy samples or DNA extracted from a living person pursuant to paragraph (6) of subdivision (c).

(B) Discloses DNA samples in violation of subdivision (d).

(g) (1) If a disclosure or failure to destroy samples described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (f) is made by an employee of the Department of Justice, the department shall be liable for those actions of its employee.

(2) Notwithstanding any other law, the remedy in this section shall be the sole and exclusive remedy against the department and its employees available to the donor of the DNA against the department and its employees.

(3) The department employee disclosing DNA or other forensic identification information or otherwise violating this section shall be absolutely immune from civil liability under this or any other law.

(h) It is not an unauthorized disclosure or violation of this section to release DNA and other forensic identification information as part of a judicial or administrative proceeding, to a jury or grand jury, or in a document filed with a court or administrative agency, or for this information to become part of the public transcript or record of proceedings.

(i) In order to maintain computer system security, the computer software and database structures used by the DNA laboratory of the Department of Justice to implement this chapter are confidential.

This division and Sections 16540, 16610, and 16870 shall be known and may be cited as the “Aroner-Scott-Hayden Firearms Safety Act of 1999.”

_(Added by Stats. 2010, Ch. 711, Sec. 6. (SB 1080) Effective January 1, 2011. Operative January 1, 2012, by Sec. 10 of Ch. 711.)_

###### 23625.



The Legislature makes the following findings:

(a) In the years 1987 to 1996, nearly 2,200 children in the United States under the age of 15 years died in unintentional shootings. In 1996 alone, 138 children were shot and killed unintentionally. Thus, more than 11 children every month, or one child every three days, were shot or killed unintentionally in firearms-related incidents.

(b) The United States leads the industrialized world in the rates of children and youth lost to unintentional, firearms-related deaths. A 1997 study from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that for unintentional firearm-related deaths for children under the age of 15, the rate in the United States was nine times higher than in 25 other industrialized countries combined.

(c) While the number of unintentional deaths from firearms is an unacceptable toll on America’s children, nearly eight times that number are treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms each year for nonfatal unintentional gunshot wounds.

(d) A study of unintentional firearm deaths among children in California found that unintentional gunshot wounds most often involve handguns.

(e) A study in the December 1995 issue of the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine found that children as young as three years old are strong enough to fire most commercially available handguns. The study revealed that 25 percent of three to four year olds and 70 percent of five to six year olds had sufficient finger strength to fire 59 (92 percent) of the 64 commonly available handguns referenced in the study.

(f) The Government Accounting Office (GAO), in its March 1991 study, “Accidental Shootings: Many Deaths and Injuries Caused by Firearms Could be Prevented,” estimates that 31 percent of accidental deaths caused by firearms might be prevented by the addition of two safety devices: a child-resistant safety device that automatically engages and a device that indicates whether the gun is loaded. According to the study results, of the 107 unintentional firearms-related fatalities the GAO examined for the calendar years 1988 and 1989, 8 percent could have been prevented had the firearm been equipped with a child-resistant safety device. This 8 percent represents instances in which children under the age of six unintentionally shot and killed themselves or other persons.

(g) Currently, firearms are the only products manufactured in the United States that are not subject to minimum safety standards.

(h) A 1997 public opinion poll conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago in conjunction with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research found that 74 percent of Americans support safety regulation of the firearms industry.

(i) Some currently available trigger locks and other similar devices are inadequate to prevent the accidental discharge of the firearms to which they are attached, or to prevent children from gaining access to the firearm.

_(Added by Stats. 2010, Ch. 711, Sec. 6. (SB 1080) Effective January 1, 2011. Operative January 1, 2012, by Sec. 10 of Ch. 711.)_

###### 23630.



(a) This division does not apply to the commerce of any antique firearm.

(b) (1) This division does not apply to the commerce of any firearm intended to be used by a salaried, full-time peace officer, as defined in Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 830) of Title 3 of Part 2, for purposes of law enforcement.

(2) Nothing in this division precludes a local government, local agency, or state law enforcement agency from requiring its peace officers to store their firearms in gun safes or attach firearm safety devices to those firearms.

_(Added by Stats. 2010, Ch. 711, Sec. 6. (SB 1080) Effective January 1, 2011. Operative January 1, 2012, by Sec. 10 of Ch. 711.)_

###### 23635.



(a) Any firearm sold or transferred in this state by a licensed firearms dealer, including a private transfer through a dealer, and any firearm manufactured in this state, shall include or be accompanied by a firearm safety device that is listed on the Department of Justice’s roster of approved firearm safety devices and that is identified as appropriate for that firearm by reference to either the manufacturer and model of the firearm, or to the physical characteristics of the firearm that match those listed on the roster for use with the device.

(b) The sale or transfer of a firearm shall be exempt from subdivision (a) if both of the following apply:

(1) The purchaser or transferee owns a gun safe that meets the standards set forth in Section 23650. Gun safes shall not be required to be tested, and therefore may meet the standards without appearing on the Department of Justice roster.

(2) The purchaser or transferee presents an original receipt for purchase of the gun safe, or other proof of purchase or ownership of the gun safe as authorized by the Attorney General, to the firearms dealer. The dealer shall maintain a copy of this receipt or proof of purchase with the dealer’s record of sales of firearms.

(c) The sale or transfer of a firearm shall be exempt from subdivision (a) if all of the following apply:

(1) The purchaser or transferee purchases an approved safety device no more than 30 days prior to the day the purchaser or transferee takes possession of the firearm.

(2) The purchaser or transferee presents the approved safety device to the firearms dealer when picking up the firearm.

(3) The purchaser or transferee presents an original receipt to the firearms dealer, which shows the date of purchase, the name, and the model number of the safety device.

(4) The firearms dealer verifies that the requirements in paragraphs (1) to (3), inclusive, have been satisfied.

(5) The firearms dealer maintains a copy of the receipt along with the dealer’s record of sales of firearms.

(d) (1) Any long-gun safe commercially sold or transferred in this state, or manufactured in this state for sale in this state, that does not meet the standards for gun safes adopted pursuant to Section 23650 shall be accompanied by the following warning:

“WARNING: This gun safe does not meet the safety standards for gun safes specified in California Penal Code Section 23650. It does not satisfy the requirements of Penal Code Section 23635, which mandates that all firearms sold in California be accompanied by a firearm safety device or proof of ownership, as required by law, of a gun safe that meets the Section 23650 minimum safety standards developed by the California Attorney General.”

(2) This warning shall be conspicuously displayed in its entirety on the principal display panel of the gun safe’s package, on any descriptive materials that accompany the gun safe, and on a label affixed to the front of the gun safe.

(3) This warning shall be displayed in both English and Spanish, in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography, layout, or color with other printed matter on the package or descriptive materials, in a manner consistent with Part 1500.121 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or successor regulations thereto.

(e) Any firearm sold or transferred in this state by a licensed firearms dealer, including a private transfer through a dealer, and any firearm manufactured in this state, shall be accompanied by warning language or a label as described in Section 23640.

_(Added by Stats. 2010, Ch. 711, Sec. 6. (SB 1080) Effective January 1, 2011. Operative January 1, 2012, by Sec. 10 of Ch. 711.)_

###### 23640.



(a) (1) The packaging of any firearm and any descriptive materials that accompany any firearm sold or transferred in this state, or delivered for sale in this state, by any licensed manufacturer or licensed dealer, shall bear a label containing the following warning statement:

WARNING

Firearms must be handled responsibly and securely stored to prevent access by children and other unauthorized users.

(a) If any section, subdivision, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of any provision in this division is for any reason held unconstitutional, that decision does not affect the validity of any other provision in the division. The Legislature hereby declares that it would have passed the provisions listed in this division and each chapter, section, subdivision, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, and phrase of those provisions irrespective of the fact that any one or more other sections, subdivisions, paragraphs, subparagraphs, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared unconstitutional.

(b) If any application of any provision in this division to any person, group of persons, or circumstances is found by a court to be invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining applications of that provision to all other persons and circumstances shall be severed and shall not be affected. All constitutionally valid applications of this division shall be severed from any applications that a court finds to be invalid, leaving the valid applications in force, because it is the Legislature’s intent and priority that the valid applications be allowed to stand alone. Even if a reviewing court finds a provision of this division to impose an unconstitutional burden in a large or substantial fraction of relevant cases, the applications that do not present an unconstitutional burden shall be severed from the remaining applications and shall remain in force, and shall be treated as if the Legislature had enacted a statute limited to the persons, group of persons, or circumstances for which the statute’s application does not present an unconstitutional burden. If any court declares or finds a provision of this division facially unconstitutional, when discrete applications of that provision can be enforced against a person, group of persons, or circumstances without violating the United States Constitution and the California Constitution, those applications shall be severed from all remaining applications of the provision, and the provision shall be interpreted as if the Legislature had enacted a provision limited to the persons, group of persons, or circumstances for which the provision’s application will not violate the United States Constitution and the California Constitution.

###### 26206.



(a) If a new license or license renewal pursuant to Section 26150, 26155, or 26170 is denied or revoked based on a determination that the applicant is a disqualified person for such a license, as set forth in Section 26202, the licensing authority shall provide the applicant with the notice of this determination as required under subdivision (d) of Section 26202, Section 26205, or paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 26195. The notice shall state the reason as to why the determination was made and also inform the applicant that they may request a hearing from a court, as provided in this section, to review the denial or revocation. The licensing authority shall provide the applicant with a copy of the most recent “Request for Hearing to Challenge Disqualified Person Determination” form prescribed by the Department of Justice under this section.

(b) The department shall develop a “Request for Hearing to Challenge Disqualified Person Determination” form for use throughout the state. The form shall include an authorization for the release of the applicant’s criminal history records to the appropriate court solely for use in the hearing conducted pursuant to this section. The “Request for Hearing to Challenge Disqualified Person Determination” form is deemed to be a local form expressly exempt from the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).

(c) Except as specified in paragraph (2), an applicant shall have 30 days after the receipt of the notice of denial described in subdivision (a) to request a hearing to review the denial or revocation from the superior court of their county of residence. The request for hearing shall be made on the “Request for Hearing to Challenge Disqualified Person Determination” form prescribed by the department.

(1) Nothing in this section prevents a licensing authority from requiring an applicant to use and exhaust any process for appealing a denial or revocation that may be offered by the licensing authority prior to 30 days after the receipt of the notice of denial described in subdivision (a) before the applicant may request a hearing as described in this subdivision. Licensing authorities that require applicants to use such a process shall resolve any appeal within 60 days of when the appeal is filed.

(2) If an applicant uses and exhausts any process for appealing a denial or revocation that is offered by the licensing authority as described in paragraph (1), an applicant shall have 30 days after receiving notice of an unsuccessful appeal to request a hearing to review the denial or revocation from the superior court of their county of residence. The request for hearing shall be made on the “Request for Hearing to Challenge Disqualified Person Determination” form prescribed by the department.

(d) (1) An applicant who has requested a hearing under this section shall be given a hearing. The clerk of the court shall set a hearing date and notify the person, the licensing authority, the department, and the district attorney. The people of the State of California shall be the plaintiff in the proceeding and shall be represented by the district attorney. Within 14 days after receiving from the clerk of the court the request for a hearing, the department shall file copies of the applicant’s criminal history report described in this section with the superior court under seal, and the licensing authority shall file any records or reports on which it relied in denying or revoking the license at issue with the superior court. The licensing authority may also, or instead, file a declaration that summarizes the information it relied upon in denying or revoking the license at issue. The reports filed by the department and the licensing authority shall be disclosed to the person and to the district attorney upon request. The court, upon motion of the applicant establishing that confidential information is likely to be discussed during the hearing that would cause harm to the person, shall conduct the hearing in camera, with only the relevant parties present, unless the court finds that the public interest would be better served by conducting the hearing in public.

(2) The court shall set the hearing within 60 days of receipt of the request for a hearing. Upon showing good cause, the district attorney shall be entitled to a continuance not to exceed 30 days after the district attorney was notified of the hearing date by the clerk of the court. If additional continuances are granted, the total length of time for continuances shall not exceed 60 days.

(3) Notwithstanding any other law, declarations, police reports, including criminal history information, and any other material and relevant evidence that is not excluded under Section 352 of the Evidence Code shall be admissible at the hearing under this section.

(e) The people shall bear the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant is a disqualified person in accordance with Section 26202.

(f) If the court finds at the hearing that the people have not met their burden, or if the district attorney declines or fails to go forward in the hearing, the court shall order as follows:

(1) If the applicant was denied a new license or license renewal, the court shall order that the person shall not be deemed a disqualified person to receive a new license or license renewal pursuant to Section 26150, 26155, or 26170, and that the licensing authority issue notice to proceed with the training requirements and submit the applicant’s fingerprints or the renewal notification in accordance with paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 26202. The Department of Justice shall then confirm the applicant’s eligibility to possess, receive, own, or purchase a firearm in a manner prescribed through regulations. A copy of the order shall be submitted to the Department of Justice.

(2) If the applicant’s license was revoked, the court shall order that the person’s license be reinstated with the original expiration date extended by the length of time between the date of the revocation notice provided under paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 26195 and the date of the court’s order so long as the Department of Justice confirms the applicant’s eligibility to possess, receive, own, or purchase a firearm in a manner prescribed through regulation. A copy of the order shall be submitted to the Department of Justice.

(g) If the court finds that the people have met their burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant is a disqualified person in accordance with Section 26202, the court shall inform the person of their right to file a subsequent application for a license no sooner than two years from the date of the hearing.

(h) If an applicant has been denied a license or had a license revoked based on any ground outlined in Section 26202 two or more times in a 10-year period, which determination was either not challenged or upheld at a hearing under this section, any subsequent hearings under this section for the applicant shall be conducted as described in this section, with the exception that the burden of proof shall be on the applicant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant is not a disqualified person in accordance with Section 26202.

(i) If a new license or license renewal pursuant to Section 26150, 26155, or 26170 is denied or revoked based on the applicant’s failure to satisfy paragraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 26150, paragraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 26155, or paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 26170, the licensing authority shall provide the applicant with the notice required under Section 26205 or paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 26195, as applicable, and inform the applicant that they may apply to the superior court of the county in which they reside for a writ of mandate pursuant to Section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Except as specified in paragraph (2), the application for writ of mandate shall be made within 30 days after the receipt of the notice of denial or the notice of revocation.

(1) Nothing in this section prevents a licensing authority from requiring an applicant to use and exhaust any process for appealing a denial or revocation that may be offered by the licensing authority prior to 30 days after the receipt of the notice of denial described in subdivision (a). Licensing authorities that require applicants to use such a process shall resolve any appeal within 60 days of when the appeal is filed.

(2) If an applicant uses and exhausts any process for appealing a denial or revocation that is offered by the licensing authority as described in paragraph (1), an applicant shall have 30 days after receiving notice of an unsuccessful appeal to file the application for writ of mandate described in this subdivision.

(7) Firearms must be handled responsibly and securely stored to prevent access by children and other unauthorized users.

Visit the internet website of the California Attorney General at https\://oag.ca.gov/firearms for information on firearm laws applicable to you and how you can comply.

(8) Children may be unable to distinguish firearms from toys and may operate firearms, causing severe injury or death. If you keep a firearm within any premises under your custody or control, and a person under 18 years of age gains access to the firearm and carries it off-premises, you may be guilty of a misdemeanor, unless you stored the firearm in a locked container, or locked the firearm with a locking device.

(9) You may be guilty of a misdemeanor, including a significant fine or imprisonment, if you keep a firearm where a minor is likely to access it or if a minor obtains and improperly uses it, or carries it off of the premises to a school or school-sponsored event, unless you stored the firearm in a locked container or locked the firearm with a locking device.

(10) If you negligently store or leave a firearm within any premises under your custody or control where a person under 18 years of age is likely to access it, you may be guilty of a misdemeanor, including a significant fine, unless you stored the firearm in a locked container or locked the firearm with a locking device.

(11) Discharging firearms in poorly ventilated areas, cleaning firearms, or handling ammunition may result in exposure to lead, a substance known to cause birth defects, reproductive harm, and other serious physical injury. Have adequate ventilation when discharging or cleaning firearms or handling ammunition. Wash hands thoroughly after exposure.

(12) Federal regulations provide that if you do not take physical possession of the firearm that you are acquiring ownership of within 30 days after you complete the initial background check paperwork, then you must complete the background check process a second time in order to take physical possession of that firearm.

(13) No person shall make an application to purchase more than one handgun or semiautomatic centerfire rifle within any 30-day period and no delivery shall be made to any person who has made an application to purchase more than one handgun or semiautomatic centerfire rifle within any 30-day period.

(14) If a firearm you own or possess is lost or stolen, you must report the loss or theft to a local law enforcement agency where the loss or theft occurred within five days of the time you knew or reasonably should have known that the firearm had been lost or stolen.”

(b) The show producer shall post, in a readily visible location at each entrance to the parking lot at the show, signage that states: “The transfer of firearms or ammunition on the parking lot of this facility is a crime.”

(b) The department shall modify the department’s Dealers’ Record of Sale (DROS) form to allow a PPO to be listed as the purchaser and registered owner of a firearm. The form shall also require the PPO to identify its type of business formation and to include any tax identification number or other identifying number of the PPO that may be required by the department.

(c) (1) The department shall modify the department’s DROS form to require the PPO to designate a “firearms custodian” for the firearm owned by the PPO that is listed in the DROS. A firearms custodian shall possess a valid firearms qualification permit issued by the bureau. A firearms custodian is responsible for the tracking, safekeeping, and inventory of those firearms of the PPO for which the custodian is designated, and shall serve as a point of contact for the department regarding the firearms for which the custodian is designated.

(2) If a firearms custodian is no longer employed by the PPO in that capacity, or otherwise becomes ineligible to be the firearms custodian, the PPO shall notify the department of that fact within seven days in a manner prescribed by the department, and the PPO shall notify the department of the designated replacement firearms custodian within 20 days of the original notice.

(d) A security guard shall possess a valid firearm qualification permit issued by the bureau prior to receiving a firearm from a PPO pursuant to a Certificate of Assignment (COA). A firearm shall be assigned by a PPO to a security guard who is employed to work for the PPO only when that employment requires the security guard to be armed.

(e) (1) (A) The department shall prescribe a “Certificate of Assignment” or “COA.” The COA may include fields that are in the DROS form, and shall be used to identify the employee of the PPO who has been assigned a PPO-owned firearm by the PPO pursuant to this chapter.

(B) The COA shall also be used to identify an employee of the PPO who will use his or her own firearm in the course of his or her duties as a security guard. The COA shall not require specific information regarding an employee-owned firearm.

(2) A PPO shall register a PPO-owned firearm acquired prior to July 1, 2016, as a PPO-owned firearm in a manner prescribed by the department prior to filing a COA for that firearm.

(3) Upon the PPO assigning a firearm to an employee who is a security guard, the PPO shall complete the COA and file it with the department in a timely manner as prescribed by the department.

(f) The department shall cause the information contained on the COA to be entered into the Automated Firearms System in a timely manner. Upon termination of the employment assignment that requires the security guard to be armed and the transfer of the firearm from the security guard back to the PPO, the PPO shall complete a COA indicating that the firearm is no longer assigned to the employee and that the firearm is in the possession of the PPO and shall file the COA with the department in a timely manner, as prescribed.

(g) If a security guard becomes listed on the Prohibited Armed Persons File, the department shall immediately notify the bureau of the listing by secured electronic delivery. Upon that notification, the bureau shall take appropriate action regarding the security guard. In addition, the department shall notify the PPO, in the manner the department deems appropriate, that the PPO employee is prohibited from being armed. This chapter does not prohibit the department from also notifying the bureau if a security guard has been arrested and charged with an offense that, upon conviction, would constitute a basis for revocation of a firearms qualification permit or security guard registration.

(3) Using the Prohibited Persons Relinquishment Form, the defendant shall name a designee and grant the designee power of attorney for the purpose of transferring or disposing of any firearms. The designee shall be either a local law enforcement agency or a consenting third party who is not prohibited from possessing firearms under state or federal law. The designee shall, within the time periods specified in subdivisions (d) and (e), surrender the firearms to the control of a local law enforcement agency, sell the firearms to a licensed firearms dealer, or transfer the firearms for storage to a firearms dealer pursuant to Section 29830.

(1) Inform the defendant that they are prohibited from owning, purchasing, receiving, possessing, or having under their custody or control, any firearms, ammunition, and, if applicable, ammunition feeding devices, including, but not limited to, magazines, and that they shall relinquish all firearms through a designee within the time periods set forth in subdivision (d) or (e) by surrendering the firearms to the control of a local law enforcement agency, selling the firearms to a licensed firearms dealer, or transferring the firearms for storage to a firearms dealer pursuant to Section 29830.

The court shall set a court date to confirm relinquishment of all firearms. The search warrant shall be executed within 10 days pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1534.

(B) If the court finds good cause to extend the time for providing proof of relinquishment, the court shall set a court date within 14 days for the defendant to provide proof of relinquishment.

The court shall ensure that these findings are included in the abstract of judgment. If necessary to avoid a delay in sentencing, the court may make and enter these findings within 14 days of sentencing.

(5) Failure by a defendant to timely file the completed Prohibited Persons Relinquishment Form with the assigned probation officer shall constitute an infraction punishable by a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100).

(2) Finds that the petitioner is not within a prohibited class as specified in Section 29815, 29820, 29825, or 29900, or subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 29800, and the court is not presented with any credible evidence that the petitioner is a person described in Section 8100 or 8103 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.

(3) Finds that the petitioner does not have a previous conviction under Section 29805, no matter when the prior conviction occurred.

(e) In making its decision, the court shall consider the petitioner’s continued employment, the interest of justice, any relevant evidence, and the totality of the circumstances. The court shall require, as a condition of granting relief from the prohibition under Section 29805, that the petitioner agree to participate in counseling as deemed appropriate by the court. Relief from the prohibition shall not relieve any other person or entity from any liability that might otherwise be imposed. It is the intent of the Legislature that courts exercise broad discretion in fashioning appropriate relief under this section in cases in which relief is warranted. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to require courts to grant relief to any particular petitioner.

(c) Upon filing the petition, the clerk of the court shall set the hearing date and notify the petitioner and the prosecuting attorney of the date of the hearing.

(2) Finds that the petitioner is not within a prohibited class as specified in Section 29815, 29820, 29825, or 29900, or subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 29800, and the court is not presented with any credible evidence that the petitioner is a person described in Section 8100 or 8103 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.

(3) Finds that the petitioner does not have a previous conviction under Section 29805, no matter when the prior conviction occurred.

###### 30370.



(a) Commencing July 1, 2019, the department shall electronically approve the purchase or transfer of ammunition through a vendor, as defined in Section 16151, except as otherwise specified. This approval shall occur at the time of purchase or transfer, prior to the purchaser or transferee taking possession of the ammunition. Pursuant to the authorization specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 30352, the following persons are authorized to purchase ammunition:

(1) A purchaser or transferee whose information matches an entry in the Automated Firearms System (AFS) and who is eligible to possess ammunition as specified in subdivision (b).

(2) A purchaser or transferee who has a current certificate of eligibility issued by the department pursuant to Section 26710.

(3) A purchaser or transferee who is not prohibited from purchasing or possessing ammunition in a single ammunition transaction or purchase made pursuant to the procedure developed pursuant to subdivision (c).

(b) To determine if the purchaser or transferee is eligible to purchase or possess ammunition pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), the department shall cross-reference the ammunition purchaser’s or transferee’s name, date of birth, current address, and driver’s license or other government identification number, as described in Section 28180, with the information maintained in the AFS. If the purchaser’s or transferee’s information does not match an AFS entry, the transaction shall be denied. If the purchaser’s or transferee’s information matches an AFS entry, the department shall determine if the purchaser or transferee falls within a class of persons who are prohibited from owning or possessing ammunition by cross-referencing with the Prohibited Armed Persons File. If the purchaser or transferee is prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm, the transaction shall be denied.

(c) The department shall develop a procedure in which a person who is not prohibited from purchasing or possessing ammunition may be approved for a single ammunition transaction or purchase. The department shall recover the cost of processing and regulatory and enforcement activities related to this section by charging the ammunition transaction or purchase applicant a fee not to exceed the fee charged for the department’s Dealers’ Record of Sale (DROS) process, as described in Section 28225, as it read on December 31, 2019, and not to exceed the department’s reasonable costs.

(d) A vendor is prohibited from providing a purchaser or transferee ammunition without department approval.

This option is available to ammunition vendors who can demonstrate legitimate geographical and telecommunications limitations in submitting the information electronically and who are approved by the department to use the telephone line verification.

(e) The department shall recover the reasonable cost of regulatory and enforcement activities related to this article by charging ammunition purchasers and transferees a per transaction fee not to exceed one dollar ($1), provided, however, that the Attorney General may adjust the fee as needed pursuant to this section, not to exceed the reasonable regulatory and enforcement costs for operating the program related to this article.

(f) A fund to be known as the “Ammunition Safety and Enforcement Special Fund” is hereby created within the State Treasury. All fees received pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the Ammunition Safety and Enforcement Special Fund and, notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, are continuously appropriated for purposes of implementing, operating, and enforcing the ammunition authorization program provided for in this section and Section 30352 and for repaying the start-up loan provided for in Section 30371.

(g) The Department of Justice is authorized to adopt regulations to implement this section.

_(Added November 8, 2016, by initiative Proposition 63, Sec. 8.15.)_

###### 30372.



(a) If a person attempts to purchase or otherwise acquire ammunition and the sale or other transfer is not approved by the Department of Justice pursuant to Section 30370 because the person is prohibited from possessing ammunition pursuant to Section 30305, the department shall notify the local law enforcement agency with primary jurisdiction in which the person was last known to reside of the attempt.

(b) A local law enforcement agency that receives a notification pursuant to subdivision (a) may investigate whether the person is in unlawful possession of a firearm. However, the law enforcement agency shall not contact the person until it has attempted to confirm both of the following:

(1) That the person is prohibited from possessing ammunition pursuant to Section 30305.

(2) That the person did in fact attempt to make the reported purchase.

(c) Subdivision (a) does not apply if the sale or other transfer is not approved only because the address in the Automated Firearms System does not match the address on the person’s identification, if there is a matching file with the same name, date of birth, and identification number.

(d) This section does not authorize a law enforcement agency to conduct a search without a warrant.

###### 30500.



This chapter shall be known as the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 and the .50 Caliber BMG Regulation Act of 2004.

_(Added by Stats. 2010, Ch. 711, Sec. 6. (SB 1080) Effective January 1, 2011. Operative January 1, 2012, by Sec. 10 of Ch. 711.)_

###### 30505.



(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the proliferation and use of assault weapons poses a threat to the health, safety, and security of all citizens of this state. The Legislature has restricted the assault weapons specified in Section 30510 based upon finding that each firearm has such a high rate of fire and capacity for firepower that its function as a legitimate sports or recreational firearm is substantially outweighed by the danger that it can be used to kill and injure human beings. It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this chapter to place restrictions on the use of assault weapons and to establish a registration and permit procedure for their lawful sale and possession. It is not, however, the intent of the Legislature by this chapter to place restrictions on the use of those weapons which are primarily designed and intended for hunting, target practice, or other legitimate sports or recreational activities.

(b) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the proliferation and use of .50 BMG rifles poses a clear and present terrorist threat to the health, safety, and security of all residents of, and visitors to, this state, based upon findings that those firearms have such a high capacity for long distance and highly destructive firepower that they pose an unacceptable risk to the death and serious injury of human beings, destruction or serious damage of vital public and private buildings, civilian, police and military vehicles, power generation and transmission facilities, petrochemical production and storage facilities, and transportation infrastructure. It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this chapter to place restrictions on the use of these rifles and to establish a registration and permit procedure for their lawful sale and possession.

_(Added by Stats. 2010, Ch. 711, Sec. 6. (SB 1080) Effective January 1, 2011. Operative January 1, 2012, by Sec. 10 of Ch. 711.)_

_(Added by Stats. 2010, Ch. 711, Sec. 6. (SB 1080) Effective January 1, 2011. Operative January 1, 2012, by Sec. 10 of Ch. 711.)_

\


###### 31900.



As used in this part, the “drop safety requirement for handguns” means that at the conclusion of the firing requirements for handguns described in Section 31905, the same certified independent testing laboratory shall subject the same three handguns of the make and model for which certification is sought, to the following test:

(a) A primed case (no powder or projectile) shall be inserted into the chamber. For a pistol, the slide shall be released, allowing it to move forward under the impetus of the recoil spring, and an empty magazine shall be inserted. For both a pistol and a revolver, the weapon shall be placed in a drop fixture capable of dropping the pistol from a drop height of 1m + 1cm (39.4 + 0.4 in.) onto the largest side of a slab of solid concrete having minimum dimensions of 7.5 x 15 x 15 cm (3 x 6 x 6 in.). The drop distance shall be measured from the lowermost portion of the weapon to the top surface of the slab. The weapon shall be dropped from a fixture and not from the hand. The weapon shall be dropped in the condition that it would be in if it were dropped from a hand (cocked with no manual safety applied). If the pistol is designed so that upon leaving the hand a “safety” is automatically applied by the pistol, this feature shall not be defeated. An approved drop fixture is a short piece of string with the weapon attached at one end and the other end held in an air vise until the drop is initiated.

(b) The following six drops shall be performed:

(1) Normal firing position with barrel horizontal.

(2) Upside down with barrel horizontal.

(3) On grip with barrel vertical.

(4) On muzzle with barrel vertical.

(5) On either side with barrel horizontal.

(6) If there is an exposed hammer or striker, on the rearmost point of that device, otherwise on the rearmost point of the weapon.

(c) The primer shall be examined for indentations after each drop. If indentations are present, a fresh primed case shall be used for the next drop.

(d) The handgun shall pass this test if each of the three test guns does not fire the primer.

_(Added by Stats. 2010, Ch. 711, Sec. 6. (SB 1080) Effective January 1, 2011. Operative January 1, 2012, by Sec. 10 of Ch. 711.)_

###### 31905.



(a) As used in this part, “firing requirement for handguns” means a test in which the manufacturer provides three handguns of the make and model for which certification is sought to an independent testing laboratory certified by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 32010. These handguns may not be refined or modified in any way from those that would be made available for retail sale if certification is granted. The magazines of a tested pistol shall be identical to those that would be provided with the pistol to a retail customer.

(b) The test shall be conducted as follows:

(1) The laboratory shall fire 600 rounds from each gun, stopping after each series of 50 rounds has been fired for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the weapon to cool, stopping after each series of 100 rounds has been fired to tighten any loose screws and clean the gun in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, and stopping as needed to refill the empty magazine or cylinder to capacity before continuing.

(2) The ammunition used shall be of the type recommended by the handgun manufacturer in the user manual, or if none is recommended, any standard ammunition of the correct caliber in new condition that is commercially available.

(c) A handgun shall pass this test if each of the three test guns meets both of the following:

(1) Fires the first 20 rounds without a malfunction that is not due to ammunition that fails to detonate.

(2) Fires the full 600 rounds with no more than six malfunctions that are not due to ammunition that fails to detonate and without any crack or breakage of an operating part of the handgun that increases the risk of injury to the user.

(d) If a pistol or revolver fails the requirements of either paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (c) due to ammunition that fails to detonate, the pistol or revolver shall be retested from the beginning of the “firing requirement for handguns” test. A new model of the pistol or revolver that failed due to ammunition that fails to detonate may be submitted for the test to replace the pistol or revolver that failed.

(e) As used in this section, “malfunction” means a failure to properly feed, fire, or eject a round, or failure of a pistol to accept or eject the magazine, or failure of a pistol’s slide to remain open after the magazine has been expended.

_(Added by Stats. 2010, Ch. 711, Sec. 6. (SB 1080) Effective January 1, 2011. Operative January 1, 2012, by Sec. 10 of Ch. 711.)_

###### 31910.



(a) As used in this part, “unsafe handgun” means any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person, for which any of the following is true:

(1) For a revolver:

(A) It does not have a safety device that, either automatically in the case of a double-action firing mechanism, or by manual operation in the case of a single-action firing mechanism, causes the hammer to retract to a point where the firing pin does not rest upon the primer of the cartridge.

(B) It does not meet the firing requirement for handguns.

(C) It does not meet the drop safety requirement for handguns.

(2) For a pistol:

(A) It does not have a positive manually operated safety device, as determined by standards relating to imported guns promulgated by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

(B) It does not meet the firing requirement for handguns.

(C) It does not meet the drop safety requirement for handguns.

(D) Commencing July 1, 2022, for all centerfire semiautomatic pistols that are not already listed on the roster pursuant to Section 32015, it does not have a chamber load indicator.

(E) Commencing July 1, 2022, for all centerfire or rimfire semiautomatic pistols that are not already listed on the roster pursuant to Section 32015, it does not have a magazine disconnect mechanism if it has a detachable magazine.

(b) The Department of Justice shall, for each semiautomatic pistol newly added to the roster pursuant to Section 32015, remove from the roster exactly three semiautomatic pistols lacking one or more of the applicable features described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) and added to the roster before July 1, 2022. Notwithstanding those subparagraphs, each semiautomatic pistol removed from the roster pursuant to this subdivision shall be considered an unsafe handgun. The Attorney General shall remove semiautomatic pistols from the roster pursuant to this subdivision in reverse order of their dates of addition to the roster, beginning with the semiautomatic pistol added to the roster on the earliest date and continuing until each semiautomatic pistol on the roster includes each of the applicable features described in those subparagraphs.
