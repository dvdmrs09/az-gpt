All labels of foods, drugs, devices, or cosmetics shall conform with the requirements of the declaration of net quantity of contents of Section 4 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (80 Stat. 1296; 15 U.S.C., Sec. 1451) and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. Foods, drugs, devices, and cosmetics exempted from the requirements of Section 4 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, however, are also exempt from this article.

_(Added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 1996.)_

This section, however, does not prohibit supplemental statements, at other places on the package, describing in nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents. Such supplemental statements of net quantity of contents shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count that tends to exaggerate the amount of the commodity contained in the package.

_(Added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 1996.)_

###### 110355.



Whenever the department determines that regulations containing prohibitions or requirements, other than those prescribed by Section 110340, are necessary to prevent the deception of consumers or to facilitate value comparisons as to any food, drug, device, or cosmetic, the department shall adopt regulations with respect to that commodity.

_(Added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 1996.)_

###### 110360.

_(Added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 1996.)_

###### 110365.



The department may regulate the placement upon any package that contains any food, drug, device, or cosmetic or upon any label affixed to the article, of any printed matter stating or representing by implication that the article is offered for retail sale at a price lower than the ordinary and customary retail sale price or that a retail sale price advantage is accorded to any purchaser of the article by reason of the size of that package or the quantity of its contents.

###### 110370.



The department may require that the label on each package of a food, drug, device, or cosmetic bear the common or usual name of the article, if any, and in case the article consists of two or more ingredients, the common or usual name of each ingredient listed in order of decreasing predominance by weight. This section, however, does not require that any trade secret be divulged.

_(Added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 1996.)_

###### 110371.



(a) A professional cosmetic manufactured on or after July 1, 2020, for sale in this state shall have a label affixed on the container that satisfies all of the labeling requirements for any other cosmetic pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. Sec. 301, et seq.), and the federal Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1451, et seq.).

(b) The following definitions shall apply to this section:

(1) “Ingredient” has the same meaning as in Section 111791.5.

(2) “Professional” means a person that has been granted a license by the State Board of Barbering and Cosmetology to practice in the field of cosmetology, nail care, barbering, or esthetics.

(3) “Professional cosmetic” means a cosmetic product as it is defined in Section 109900 that is intended or marketed to be used only by a professional on account of a specific ingredient, increased concentration of an ingredient, or other quality that requires safe handling, or is otherwise used by a professional.

_(Added by Stats. 2018, Ch. 393, Sec. 2. (AB 2775) Effective January 1, 2019.)_

###### 110375.



(a)  No container wherein commodities are packed shall have a false bottom, false sidewalls, false lid or covering, or be otherwise so constructed or filled, wholly or partially, as to facilitate the perpetration of deception or fraud.

(b)  No container shall be made, formed, or filled as to be misleading. A container that does not allow the consumer to fully view its contents shall be considered to be filled as to be misleading if it contains nonfunctional slack fill. Slack fill is the difference between the actual capacity of a container and the volume of product contained therein. Nonfunctional slack fill is the empty space in a package that is filled to substantially less than its capacity for reasons other than any one or more of the following:

(1) Protection of the contents of the package.

(2) The requirements of machines used for enclosing the contents of the package.

(3) Unavoidable product settling during shipping and handling.

(4) The need to utilize a larger than required package or container to provide adequate space for the legible presentation of mandatory and necessary labeling information, such as those based on the regulations adopted by the United States Food and Drug Administration or state or federal agencies under federal or state law, laws or regulations adopted by foreign governments, or under an industrywide voluntary labeling program.

(5) The fact that the product consists of a commodity that is packaged in a decorative or representational container where the container is part of the presentation of the product and has value that is both significant in proportion to the value of the product and independent of its function to hold the product, such as a gift combined with a container that is intended for further use after the product is consumed, or durable commemorative or promotional packages.

(6) An inability to increase the level of fill or to further reduce the size of the package, such as where some minimum package size is necessary to accommodate required labeling, discourage pilfering, facilitate handling, or accommodate tamper-resistant devices.

(7) The product container bears a reasonable relationship to the actual amount of product contained inside, and the dimensions of the actual product container, the product, or the amount of product therein is visible to the consumer at the point of sale, or where obvious secondary use packaging is involved.

(8) One or more of the following:

(A) The dimensions of the product or immediate product container are visible through the exterior packaging.

(B) The actual size of the product or immediate product container is clearly and conspicuously depicted on any side of the exterior packaging, excluding the bottom, accompanied by a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the depiction is the “actual size” of the product or immediate product container. If there are multiple units of the same product in a package, only one “actual size” depiction is required per same size product or immediate product container.

(C) A line or a graphic that represents the product or product fill and a statement communicating that the line or graphic represents the product or product fill such as “Fill Line,” both of which are clearly and conspicuously depicted on exterior packaging or the immediate product container if visible at point of sale. If the product is subject to settling, the line shall represent the minimum amount of product after settling.

(9) The presence of any headspace within an immediate product container necessary to facilitate the mixing, adding, shaking, or dispensing of liquids or powders by consumers before use.

(10) The exterior packaging contains a product delivery or dosing device if the device is visible, or a clear and conspicuous depiction of the device appears on the exterior packaging, or it is readily apparent from the conspicuous exterior disclosures or the nature and name of the product that a delivery or dosing device is contained in the package.

(11) The exterior packaging or immediate product container is a kit that consists of a system, or multiple components, designed to produce a particular result that is not dependent upon the quantity of the contents, if the purpose of the kit is clearly and conspicuously disclosed on the exterior packaging.

(12) The exterior packaging of the product is routinely displayed using tester units or demonstrations to consumers in retail stores, so that customers can see the actual, immediate container of the product being sold, or a depiction of the actual size of the container before purchase.

(13) The exterior packaging consists of single or multiunit presentation boxes of holiday or gift packages if the purchaser can adequately determine the quantity and sizes of the immediate product container at the point of sale.

(14) The exterior packaging is for a combination of one purchased product, together with a free sample or gift, wherein the exterior packaging is necessarily larger than it would otherwise be due to the inclusion of the sample or gift, if the presence of both products and the quantity of each product are clearly and conspicuously disclosed on the exterior packaging.

(15) The mode of commerce does not allow the consumer to view or handle the physical container or product.

(c) Slack fill in a package shall not be used as grounds to allege a violation of this section based solely on its presence unless it is nonfunctional slack fill.

(d) Any sealer may seize a container that facilitates the perpetration of deception or fraud and the contents of the container. By order of the superior court of the county within which a violation of this section occurs, the containers seized shall be condemned and destroyed or released upon any condition as the court may impose to ensure against their use in violation of this chapter. The contents of any condemned container shall be returned to the owner if the owner furnishes proper facilities for the return.

_(Amended by Stats. 2018, Ch. 544, Sec. 3. (AB 2632) Effective January 1, 2019.)_

###### 110380.

(a) The department shall regulate candy to ensure that the candy is not adulterated.

(b) For the purposes of this chapter, “candy” means any confectionary intended for individual consumption that contains chili, tamarind, or any other ingredient identified as posing a health risk in regulations adopted by the office or department.

(c) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:

(1) “Office” means the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.

(2) “Adulterated candy” means any candy with lead in excess of the naturally occurring level. Moreover, candy is adulterated if its wrapper or the ink on the wrapper contains lead in excess of standards which the office, in consultation with the department and the Attorney General, shall establish by July 1, 2006.

(3) “Naturally occurring level” of lead in candy shall be determined by regulations adopted by the office after consultation with the department and the Attorney General. For purposes of this section, the “naturally occurring level” of lead in candy is only naturally occurring to the extent that it is not avoidable by good agricultural, manufacturing, and procurement practices, or by other practices currently feasible. The producer and manufacturer of candy and candy ingredients shall at all times use quality control measures that reduce the natural chemical contaminants to the “lowest level currently feasible” as this term is used in subsection (c) of Section 110.110 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The “naturally occurring level” of lead shall not include any lead in an ingredient resulting from agricultural equipment, fuels used on or around soils or crops, fertilizers, pesticides, or other materials that are applied to soils or crops or added to water used to irrigate soils or crops. The office shall determine the naturally occurring levels of lead in candy containing chili and tamarind no later than July 1, 2006. The office shall determine the naturally occurring levels of lead in candy containing other ingredients upon request by the department or the Attorney General, and in the absence of a request, when the office determines that the presence of the ingredient in candy may pose a health risk. Until the office adopts regulations determining the naturally occurring level of lead, the Attorney General’s written determination, if any, including any determination set forth in a consent judgment entered into by the Attorney General, of the naturally occurring level of lead in candy or in a candy ingredient shall be binding for purposes of this section.

(4) “Wrapper” means all packaging materials in contact with the candy, including, but not limited to, the paper cellophane, plastic container, stick handle, spoon, small pot (olla), and squeeze tube, or similar devices. “Wrapper” does not include any part of the packaging from which lead will not leach, as demonstrated by the manufacturer, to the satisfaction of the office.

(d) The standards adopted pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (c) shall be reviewed by the office every three-year to five-year period in order to determine whether advances in scientific knowledge, the development of better agricultural or manufacturing practices, or changes in detection limits require revision of the standards.

(e) The department shall do all of the following:

(1) Ensure that the candy is not adulterated.

(2) Establish procedures for the testing of candy and the certification of unadulterated candy products. The procedures shall require candy manufacturers to certify candy as being unadulterated. The certification shall be based on appropriate sampling and testing protocols as determined by the office in consultation with the Attorney General’s office.

(3) Through its Food and Drug Branch, test the samples of candy collected pursuant to this article. The department may test any candy, including candy tested pursuant to paragraph (2) in order to ensure the candy is unadulterated.

(4) Adopt regulations necessary for the enforcement of this article.

(5) Evaluate the regulatory process, identify problems, and make changes or report to the Legislature, as necessary.

(f) If the candy tested pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (e) is found to be adulterated, the department shall do both of the following:

(1) Issue health advisory notices to county health departments alerting them to the danger posed by consumption of the candy.

(2) Notify the manufacturer and the distributor of the candy that the candy is adulterated, and that the candy may not be sold or distributed in the state until further testing proves that the candy is unadulterated.

(g) (1) For any candy found to be adulterated, the manufacturer or distributor may request that the department test a subsequent sample of candy. The department shall select the candy to be tested. The cost of any subsequent sampling and testing shall be borne by the manufacturer or distributor requesting the additional testing.

(2) If the candy is found to be unadulterated when it is retested, the department shall provide the manufacturer or distributor and the county health department with a letter stating that the candy has been retested and determined to be unadulterated, and that the sale and distribution of the candy in the state may resume.

(3) If the candy is found to remain adulterated when retested, the manufacturer or distributor may take corrective measures and continue to resubmit samples for testing until tests prove the candy unadulterated.

(h) (1) The sale of adulterated candy to California consumers is a violation of this section. Any person knowingly and intentionally selling adulterated candy shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500) per violation. The regulations adopted shall provide that funding for this section shall be met in part or in whole by those penalties, upon appropriation by the Legislature.

(2) In the event that a candy product is found to be adulterated, the department may recover the costs incurred in the chemical analysis of that product from the manufacturer or distributor.

(3) Except as expressly set forth in this section, nothing in this section shall alter or diminish any legal obligation otherwise required in common law or by statute or regulation, and nothing in this section shall create or enlarge any defense in any action to enforce that legal obligation. Penalties imposed under this section shall be in addition to any penalties otherwise prescribed by law.

(4) This section shall not be the basis for any stay of proceedings or other order limiting or delaying the prosecution of any action to enforce Section 25249.6.

(9) The following statement:

“The sources of bottled water include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water naturally travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it can pick up naturally occurring substances as well as substances that are present due to animal and human activity.

Substances that may be present in the source water include any of the following:

(1) Inorganic substances, including, but not limited to, salts and metals, that can be naturally occurring or result from farming, urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, or oil and gas production.

(2) Pesticides and herbicides that may come from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, agriculture, urban stormwater runoff, and residential uses.

(3) Organic substances that are byproducts of industrial processes and petroleum production and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff, agricultural application, and septic systems.

(4) Microbial organisms that may come from wildlife, agricultural livestock operations, sewage treatment plants, and septic systems.

(5) Substances with radioactive properties that can be naturally occurring or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities.”

(10) The following statement:

“In order to ensure that bottled water is safe to drink, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the State Department of Public Health prescribe regulations that limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by bottled water companies.”

(11) (A) The following statement, if nitrate (NO3) levels above 23 ppm but below 45 ppm (the maximum contaminant level for nitrate (NO3)) are detected:

“Nitrate in drinking water at levels above 45 mg/L is a health risk for infants of less than six months of age. These nitrate levels in drinking water can interfere with the capacity of the infant’s blood to carry oxygen, resulting in a serious illness. Symptoms include shortness of breath and blueness of the skin. Nitrate levels above 45 mg/L may also affect the ability of the blood to carry oxygen in other individuals, including, but not limited to, pregnant women and those with certain specific enzyme deficiencies. If you are caring for an infant, or you are pregnant, you should ask advice from your health care provider.”

(B) If the nitrate disclosure requirements for municipal water suppliers are revised by the State Department of Public Health, this statement shall be updated to reflect the revision.

(12) (A) The following statement, if arsenic levels above 5 ppb, but below 10 ppb (the maximum contaminant level for arsenic), are detected:

“Arsenic levels above 5 ppb and up to 10 ppb are present in your drinking water. While your drinking water meets the current EPA standard for arsenic, it does contain low levels of arsenic. The standard balances the current understanding of arsenic’s possible health effects against the costs of removing arsenic from drinking water. The State Department of Public Health continues to research the health effects of low levels of arsenic, which is a mineral known to cause cancer in humans at high concentrations and is linked to other health effects, including, but not limited to, skin damage and circulatory problems.”

(b)  “Beverage container” means the individual, separate, sealed glass, metal or plastic bottle, can, jar or carton containing a beverage.

(c)  “Flip-top container” means a metal beverage container so designed and constructed that a part of the container is severable in opening the containers.

(d)  “In this state” means within the exterior limits of the State of California and includes all territory within these limits owned by or ceded to the United States of America.

(e)  “Non-flip-top container” means a metal beverage container so designed and constructed that no part of the container is severable in opening the container.

_(Amended by Stats. 1996, Ch. 1023, Sec. 316. Effective September 29, 1996.)_

###### 113205.



On and after January 1, 1979, no person shall sell or offer for sale in this state any metal beverage container so designed and constructed that a part of the container is severable in opening the container. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the sale in California of the containers for shipment out of state.

Any person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of an infraction.

_(Added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 1996.)_

###### 113210.



The Secretary of the Resources Agency may extend permission to a manufacturer to sell flip-top containers for one or more periods of time for a total period not to exceed one year after January 1, 1979. The subsequent resale of these flip-top containers by other persons at wholesale or retail, empty or filled with beverages at any time subsequent to January 1, 1979, shall not be a violation of Section 113205.

In order to be eligible for an extension of permission to sell flip-top containers after January 1, 1979, a manufacturer shall file a request for extension by July 1, 1978, with the Secretary of the Resources Agency and shall accompany the request with a report that will indicate:

(a)  The percentage of the total production of metal beverage containers made by the manufacturer in the calendar years of 1976 and 1977, and to May 31, 1978, that were non-flip-top containers manufactured for use within this state.

(b)  The percentage of production of metal beverage containers the manufacturer shifted from flip-top containers to non-flip-top containers in the calendar years 1976 and 1977, and to May 31, 1978, for use within this state.

(c)  The projected date when all production of metal beverage containers manufactured for use in this state will be non-flip-top containers.

(d)  A general statement of the procedures the manufacturer is employing to effect the changeover to production of only non-flip-top containers for use within this state, and specific economic information regarding the manufacturer’s planned investment in conversion to new equipment and techniques to effect the changeover to production of only non-flip-top containers for use within this state.

The secretary shall make public disclosure of all reports received.

_(Added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 1996.)_

###### 113215.



The Secretary of the Resources Agency shall conduct hearings upon the requests for extension prior to making decisions, so that members of the public and manufacturers may be heard, and shall receive evidence and make findings of fact. The secretary shall cause public notification of the time and place of the hearings 30 days prior to each hearing.

In order to grant an extension of permission to sell flip-top containers after January 1, 1979, the Secretary of the Resources Agency must make a determination that the manufacturer requesting the extension has made good faith efforts to comply with the act, but is unable to meet the time requirement for conversion, and that the manufacturer will suffer severe economic hardship as a direct result of the requirements of conversion.

If an extension is granted, the Secretary of the Resources Agency may require reports as often as he or she deems necessary, indicating the progress of the manufacturer toward compliance.

_(Added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 1996.)_

###### 113220.



There shall be no administrative appeal of the secretary’s decision regarding a request for an extension. Judicial review of the decision of the Secretary of the Resources Agency on any request for an extension may be made by the manufacturer. In addition, any member of the public, without damages, at his or her own expense, has standing to bring an action for the purpose of inquiring into the validity of a decision of the secretary on the grounds of the abuse of discretion where the findings are unsupported by the evidence. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the use of any other remedy available under any other provision of law.

###### 115700.



(a)  Every person owning land in fee simple or in possession thereof under lease or contract of sale who knowingly permits the existence on the premises of any abandoned mining shaft, pit, well, septic tank, cesspool, or other abandoned excavation dangerous to persons legally on the premises, or to minors under the age of 12 years, who fails to cover, fill, or fence securely that dangerous abandoned excavation and keep it so protected, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

(b)  Every person owning land in fee simple or in possession thereof under lease or contract of sale who knowingly permits the existence on the premises of any permanently inactive well, cathodic protection well, or monitoring well that constitutes a known or probable preferential pathway for the movement of pollutants, contaminants, or poor quality water, from above ground to below ground, or vertical movement of pollutants, contaminants, or poor quality water below ground, and that movement poses a threat to the quality of the waters of the state, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

(c)  For purposes of this section, “well” includes any of the following:

(1)  A “monitoring well” as defined by Section 13712 of the Water Code.

(2)  A “cathodic well” as defined by Section 13711 of the Water Code.

(3)  A “water well” as defined by Section 13710 of the Water Code.

(d)  A “permanently inactive well” is a well that has not been used for a period of one year, unless the person owning land in fee simple or in possession thereof under lease or contract of sale demonstrates an intent for future use for water supply, groundwater recharge, drainage, or groundwater level control, heating or cooling, cathodic protection, groundwater monitoring, or related uses. A well owner shall provide evidence to the local health officer of an intent for future use of an inactive well by maintaining the well in a way that the following requirements are met:

(1)  The well shall not allow impairment of the quality of water within the well and groundwater encountered by the well.

(2)  The top of the well or well casing shall be provided with a cover, that is secured by a lock or by other means to prevent its removal without the use of equipment or tools, to prevent unauthorized access, to prevent a safety hazard to humans and animals, and to prevent illegal disposal of wastes in the well. The cover shall be watertight where the top of the well casing or other surface openings to the well are below ground level, as in a vault or below known levels of flooding. The cover shall be watertight if the well is inactive for more than five consecutive years. A pump motor, angle drive, or other surface feature of a well, when in compliance with the above provisions, shall suffice as a cover.

(3)  The well shall be marked so as to be easily visible and located, and labeled so as to be easily identified as a well.

(4)  The area surrounding the well shall be kept clear of brush, debris, and waste materials.

(e)  At a minimum, permanently inactive wells shall be destroyed in accordance with standards developed by the Department of Water Resources pursuant to Section 13800 of the Water Code and adopted by the State Water Resources Control Board or local agencies in accordance with Section 13801 of the Water Code. Minimum standards recommended by the department and adopted by the state board or local agencies for the abandonment or destruction of groundwater monitoring wells or class 1 hazardous injection wells shall not be construed to limit, abridge, or supersede the powers or duties of the department, in accordance with Section 13801 of the Water Code.

(f)  Nothing in this section is a limitation on the power of a city, county, or city and county to adopt and enforce additional penal provisions regarding the types of wells and other excavations described in subdivisions (a) and (b).

###### 115880.



(a) The department shall, by regulation and in consultation with the board, local health officers, and the public, establish, maintain, and amend as necessary, minimum standards for the sanitation of public beaches, including, but not limited to, the removal of refuse, as it determines are reasonably necessary for the protection of the public health and safety.

(b) Prior to final adoption or amendment by the department, the regulations and standards required by this section shall undergo an external comprehensive review process similar to the process set forth in Section 57004.

(c) The regulations shall, at a minimum, do all of the following:

(1) Require the testing of the waters adjacent to all public beaches for microbiological contaminants, including, but not limited to, total coliform, fecal coliform, and enterococci bacteria. The department may require the testing of waters adjacent to all public beaches for microbiological indicators other than those set forth in this paragraph, or a subset of those set forth in this paragraph, if the department affirmatively establishes, based on the best available scientific studies and the weight of the evidence, that the alternative indicators are as protective of the public health.

(2) Establish protective minimum standards for total coliform, fecal coliform, and enterococci bacteria, or for other microbiological indicators that the department determines are appropriate for testing pursuant to paragraph (1).

(3) Require that the waters adjacent to public beaches are tested for total coliform, fecal coliform, and enterococci bacteria, or for other microbiological indicators that the department determines are appropriate for testing pursuant to paragraph (1). Except as set forth in subdivision (e), testing shall be conducted on at least a weekly basis from April 1 to October 31, inclusive, of each year beginning in 2012, if both of the following apply:

(A) The beach is visited by more than 50,000 people annually.

(B) The beach is located on an area adjacent to a storm drain that flows in the summer.

(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), if a local health officer demonstrates or has demonstrated through side-by-side testing over a beach season that the use of United States Environmental Protection Agency method 1609 or 1611, or any equivalent or improved rapid detection method published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for use in beach water quality assessment or approved as an alternative test procedure pursuant to Part 136 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, to determine the level of enterococci bacteria as a single indicator provides a reliable indication of overall microbiological contamination conditions at one or more beach locations within that health officer’s jurisdiction, the department may authorize the use of that testing method at those beach locations instead of other testing methods. In making that determination, the department shall take into account whether an alternative indicator or subset of indicators, with the associated test method, can provide results more quickly, thereby reducing the period of time the public is at risk while waiting for contamination to be confirmed.

(e) The monitoring frequency and locations established pursuant to this section and related regulations may be reduced or altered only after the testing required pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) reveals levels of microbiological contaminants that do not exceed, for a period of two years, the minimum protective standards established pursuant to this section.

(f) The local health officer is responsible for testing the waters adjacent to, and coordinating the testing of, all public beaches within his or her jurisdiction.

(g) The local health officer may meet the testing requirements of this section by utilizing test results from other parties conducting microbiological contamination testing of the waters under his or her jurisdiction.

(a) “Swimming pool” or “pool” means any structure intended for swimming or recreational bathing that contains water over 18 inches deep. “Swimming pool” includes in-ground and aboveground structures and includes, but is not limited to, hot tubs, spas, portable spas, and nonportable wading pools.

(b) “Public swimming pool” means a swimming pool operated for the use of the general public with or without charge, or for the use of the members and guests of a private club. Public swimming pool does not include a swimming pool located on the grounds of a private single-family home.

(c) “Enclosure” means a fence, wall, or other barrier that isolates a swimming pool from access to the home.

(d) “Approved safety pool cover” means a manually or power-operated safety pool cover that meets all of the performance standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), in compliance with standard F1346-91.

(e) “Exit alarms” means devices that make audible, continuous alarm sounds when any door or window, that permits access from the residence to the pool area that is without any intervening enclosure, is opened or is left ajar. Exit alarms may be battery operated or may be connected to the electrical wiring of the building.

(f) “ANSI/APSP performance standard” means a standard that is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and published by the Association of Pool and Spa Professionals (APSP).

(g) “Suction outlet” means a fitting or fixture typically located at the bottom or on the sides of a swimming pool that conducts water to a recirculating pump.

_(Amended by Stats. 2012, Ch. 679, Sec. 1. (AB 2114) Effective January 1, 2013.)_

(b)  Feasible and affordable technologies are available and shall be used to remove toxic contaminants from public water supplies.

(c)  According to the State Department of Health Services, over 95 percent of all large public water systems in California are in compliance with health-based action levels established by the department for various contaminants.

(d)  It is the policy of the state to reduce to the lowest level feasible all concentrations of toxic chemicals that, when present in drinking water, may cause cancer, birth defects, and other chronic diseases.

(e)  This chapter is intended to ensure that the water delivered by public water systems of this state shall at all times be pure, wholesome, and potable. This chapter provides the means to accomplish this objective.

(f)  It is the intent of the Legislature to improve laws governing drinking water quality, to improve upon the minimum requirements of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, to establish primary drinking water standards that are at least as stringent as those established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, and to establish a program under this chapter that is more protective of public health than the minimum federal requirements.

(g)  It is the further intent of the Legislature to establish a drinking water regulatory program within the state board to provide for the orderly and efficient delivery of safe drinking water within the state and to give the establishment of drinking water standards and public health goals greater emphasis and visibility within the state.

(h) This act shall be construed to ensure consistency with the requirements for states to obtain and maintain primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto.

###### 116365.



(a) The state board shall adopt primary drinking water standards for contaminants in drinking water that are based upon the criteria set forth in subdivision (b) and shall not be less stringent than the national primary drinking water standards adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. A primary drinking water standard adopted by the state board shall be set at a level that is as close as feasible to the corresponding public health goal placing primary emphasis on the protection of public health, and that, to the extent technologically and economically feasible, meets all of the following:

(1) With respect to acutely toxic substances, avoids any known or anticipated adverse effects on public health with an adequate margin of safety.

(2) With respect to carcinogens, or any substances that may cause chronic disease, avoids any significant risk to public health.

(b) The state board shall consider all of the following criteria when it adopts a primary drinking water standard:

(1) The public health goal for the contaminant published by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment pursuant to subdivision (c).

(2) The national primary drinking water standard for the contaminant, if any, adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

(3) The technological and economic feasibility of compliance with the proposed primary drinking water standard. For the purposes of determining economic feasibility pursuant to this paragraph, the state board shall consider the costs of compliance to public water systems, customers, and other affected parties with the proposed primary drinking water standard, including the cost per customer and aggregate cost of compliance, using best available technology.

(c) (1) The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment shall prepare and publish an assessment of the risks to public health posed by each contaminant for which the state board proposes a primary drinking water standard. The risk assessment shall be prepared using the most current principles, practices, and methods used by public health professionals who are experienced practitioners in the fields of epidemiology, risk assessment, and toxicology. The risk assessment shall contain an estimate of the level of the contaminant in drinking water that is not anticipated to cause or contribute to adverse health effects, or that does not pose any significant risk to health. This level shall be known as the public health goal for the contaminant. The public health goal shall be based exclusively on public health considerations and shall be set in accordance with all of the following:

(A) If the contaminant is an acutely toxic substance, the public health goal shall be set at the level at which no known or anticipated adverse effects on health occur, with an adequate margin of safety.

(B) If the contaminant is a carcinogen or other substance that may cause chronic disease, the public health goal shall be set at the level that, based upon currently available data, does not pose any significant risk to health.

(C) To the extent information is available, the public health goal shall take into account each of the following factors:

(i) Synergistic effects resulting from exposure to, or interaction between, the contaminant and one or more other substances or contaminants.

(ii) Adverse health effects the contaminant has on members of subgroups that comprise a meaningful portion of the general population, including, but not limited to, infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, individuals with a history of serious illness, or other subgroups that are identifiable as being at greater risk of adverse health effects than the general population when exposed to the contaminant in drinking water.

(iii) The relationship between exposure to the contaminant and increased body burden and the degree to which increased body burden levels alter physiological function or structure in a manner that may significantly increase the risk of illness.

(iv) The additive effect of exposure to the contaminant in media other than drinking water, including, but not limited to, exposures to the contaminant in food, and in ambient and indoor air, and the degree to which these exposures may contribute to the overall body burden of the contaminant.

(D) If the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment finds that currently available scientific data are insufficient to determine the level of a contaminant at which no known or anticipated adverse effects on health will occur, with an adequate margin of safety, or the level that poses no significant risk to public health, the public health goal shall be set at a level that is protective of public health, with an adequate margin of safety. This level shall be based exclusively on health considerations and shall, to the extent scientific data is available, take into account the factors set forth in clauses (i) to (iv), inclusive, of subparagraph (C), and shall be based on the most current principles, practices, and methods used by public health professionals who are experienced practitioners in the fields of epidemiology, risk assessment, and toxicology. However, if adequate scientific evidence demonstrates that a safe dose response threshold for a contaminant exists, then the public health goal should be set at that threshold. The state board may set the public health goal at zero if necessary to satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph.

(2) The determination of the toxicological endpoints of a contaminant and the publication of its public health goal in a risk assessment prepared by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment are not subject to the requirements of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and the state board shall not impose any mandate on a public water system that requires the public water system to comply with a public health goal. The Legislature finds and declares that the addition of this paragraph by Chapter 777 of the Statutes of 1999 is declaratory of existing law.

(3) (A) The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment shall, at the time it commences preparation of a risk assessment for a contaminant as required by this subdivision, electronically post on its Internet Web site a notice that informs interested persons that it has initiated work on the risk assessment. The notice shall also include a brief description, or a bibliography, of the technical documents or other information the office has identified to date as relevant to the preparation of the risk assessment and inform persons who wish to submit information concerning the contaminant that is the subject of the risk assessment of the name and address of the person in the office to whom the information may be sent, the date by which the information shall be received in order for the office to consider it in the preparation of the risk assessment, and that all information submitted will be made available to any member of the public who requests it.

(B) A draft risk assessment prepared by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment pursuant to this subdivision shall be made available to the public at least 45 calendar days before the date that public comment and discussion on the risk assessment are solicited at the public workshop required by Section 57003.

(C) At the time the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment publishes the final risk assessment for a contaminant, the office shall respond in writing to significant comments, data, studies, or other written information submitted by interested persons to the office in connection with the preparation of the risk assessment. These comments, data, studies, or other written information submitted to the office shall be made available to any member of the public who requests it.

(D) After the public workshop on the draft risk assessment, as required by Section 57003, is completed, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment shall submit the draft risk assessment for external scientific peer review using the process set forth in Section 57004 and shall comply with paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 57004 before publication of the final public health goal.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any maximum contaminant level in effect on August 22, 1995, may be amended by the state board to make the level more stringent pursuant to this section. However, the state board may only amend a maximum contaminant level to make it less stringent if the state board shows clear and convincing evidence that the maximum contaminant level should be made less stringent and the amendment is made consistent with this section.

(e) (1) All public health goals published by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment shall be established in accordance with the requirements of subdivision (c). The office shall determine, at least once every five years, whether there has been a detection of the corresponding contaminant of each public health goal in the preceding five years in the testing required pursuant to this chapter. Each public health goal shall be reviewed at least once every five years unless the office determines, pursuant to this paragraph, that there has not been a detection of the corresponding contaminant in the preceding five years. Reviewed public health goals shall be revised, pursuant to subdivision (c), as necessary based upon the availability of new scientific data.

(2) On or before January 1, 1998, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment shall publish a public health goal for at least 25 drinking water contaminants for which a primary drinking water standard has been adopted by the state board. The office shall publish a public health goal for 25 additional drinking water contaminants by January 1, 1999, and for all remaining drinking water contaminants for which a primary drinking water standard has been adopted by the state board by no later than December 31, 2001. A public health goal shall be published by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment at the same time the state board proposes the adoption of a primary drinking water standard for any newly regulated contaminant.

(f) The state board or Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment may review, and adopt by reference, any information prepared by, or on behalf of, the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the purpose of adopting a national primary drinking water standard or maximum contaminant level goal when it establishes a California maximum contaminant level or publishes a public health goal.

(g) At least once every five years after adoption of a primary drinking water standard, the state board shall review the primary drinking water standard and shall, consistent with the criteria set forth in subdivisions (a) and (b), amend any standard if either of the following occur:

(1) Changes in technology or treatment techniques that permit a materially greater protection of public health or attainment of the public health goal.

(2) New scientific evidence that indicates that the substance may present a materially different risk to public health than was previously determined.

(h) No later than March 1 of every year, the state board shall provide public notice of each primary drinking water standard it proposes to review in that year pursuant to this section. Thereafter, the state board shall solicit and consider public comment and hold one or more public hearings regarding its proposal to either amend or maintain an existing standard. With adequate public notice, the state board may review additional contaminants not covered by the March 1 notice.

(i) This section shall operate prospectively to govern the adoption of new or revised primary drinking water standards and does not require the repeal or readoption of primary drinking water standards in effect immediately preceding January 1, 1997.

(j) The state board may, by regulation, require the use of a specified treatment technique in lieu of establishing a maximum contaminant level for a contaminant if the state board determines that it is not economically or technologically feasible to ascertain the level of the contaminant.

All local health officers shall complete the evaluation, sampling, testing, review of sampling results, and notification to the public water systems within their jurisdiction in accordance with the agreements entered into with the department and within the schedule established by the department. All work required by this section shall be completed within three years after September 19, 1985.

(e)  In consultation with the department, the local health officer shall conduct an evaluation of all small public water systems under their jurisdictions to determine the potential for contamination of groundwater sources by organic chemicals. The evaluation shall include, but not be limited to:

(1)  A review of the historical water quality data of each system to determine possible evidence of degradation.

(2)  A review, to be coordinated with the State Water Resources Control Board, and the California regional water quality control boards, of past and present waste disposal practices that may potentially affect the respective well water supply.

(3)  A review of other organic chemicals used in the water supply area that have potential health risks and that may have the potential for contaminating drinking water supplies because of environmental persistence or resistance to natural degradation under conditions existing in California.

(f)  Based upon the evaluation of each system, the local health officers shall develop a sampling plan for each system within their jurisdiction. The health officer shall collect samples in accordance with the plan and shall submit the samples for analysis to a certified laboratory designated by the department. When applicable, the laboratory shall test water samples using the Environmental Protection Agency’s 13 approved analytical techniques established under subdivision (h) of Section 304 of the Clean Water Act to qualitatively identify the complete range of contaminants in the same class as the specific contaminant or class of contaminants being analyzed.

(g)  Within 10 days of the receipt from the laboratory of the testing results, the local health officer shall notify the small public water system, the department and the California regional water quality control board for that region of the results.

(h)  Following a review of the testing results, the local health officer may order the public water system to conduct a periodic water sampling and analysis program in accordance with conditions specified by the local health officer. The department shall provide ongoing advice and assistance to local health officers in interpreting test results and determining appropriate notification and followup activities in those instances where contaminants are found.

###### 116409.



The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) Promotion of the public health of Californians of all ages by protection and maintenance of dental health through the fluoridation of drinking water is a paramount issue of statewide concern.

(b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this article to preempt local government regulations, ordinances, and initiatives that prohibit or restrict the fluoridation of drinking water by public water systems with 10,000 or more service connections, without regard to whether the public water system might otherwise be exempt from Section 116410 or the requirements of this section, pursuant to Section 116415.

(c) It is further the intent of the Legislature in establishing this article to decrease the burden the Medi-Cal and the Denti-Cal programs place upon the state’s limited funds.

_(Added by Stats. 2004, Ch. 727, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 2005.)_

###### 116410.



(a) Each public water system with at least 10,000 service connections and with a natural level of fluorides that is less than the minimum established in the regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall be fluoridated in order to promote the public health of Californians of all ages through the protection and maintenance of dental health, a paramount issue of statewide concern. The department shall adopt regulations pursuant to Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, requiring the fluoridation of public water systems. By July 1, 1996, and at 10-year intervals thereafter, each public water system with at least 10,000 service connections shall provide to the department an estimate of the total capital costs to install fluoridation treatment. The regulations adopted by the department shall take effect on January 1, 1997. Capital costs estimates are no longer required after installation of the fluoridation treatment equipment.

(b) The regulations shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

(1) Minimum and maximum permissible concentrations of fluoride to be maintained by fluoridation of public water systems.

(2) The requirements and procedures for maintaining proper concentrations of fluoride, including equipment, testing, recordkeeping, and reporting.

(3) Requirements for the addition of fluorides to public water systems in which the natural level of fluorides is less than the minimum level established in the regulations.

(4) A schedule for the fluoridation of public water systems with at least 10,000 service connections, based on the lowest capital cost per connection for each system.

(c) The purpose of the schedule established pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) is not to mandate the order in which public water systems receiving funding from private sources must fluoridate their water. Available funds may be offered to any system on the schedule.

(d) The estimates provided to the department pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section and subdivision (g) of Section 116415 of the total capital and associated costs and noncapital operation and maintenance costs related to fluoridation treatments and the similar estimates provided to those sources offering to provide the funds set forth in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 116415 shall be reasonable, as determined by the department. A registered civil engineer recognized or employed by the department who is familiar with the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of fluoridations systems shall determine for the department whether the costs are reasonable.

(e) As used in this section and Section 116415, “costs” means only those costs that require an actual expenditure of funds or resources, and do not include costs that are intangible or speculative, including, but not limited to, opportunity or indemnification costs.

(f) Any public water system with multiple water sources, when funding is not received to fluoridate all sources, is exempt from maintaining otherwise required fluoridations levels in areas receiving any nonfluoridated water. The exemption shall be in effect only until the public water system receives funding to fluoridate the entire water system and the treatment facilities are installed and operational.

_(Amended by Stats. 2004, Ch. 727, Sec. 3. Effective January 1, 2005.)_

###### 116415.



(a) (1) A public water system is not required to fluoridate pursuant to Section 116410, or the regulations adopted thereunder by the department, in any of the following situations:

(A) If the public water system is listed on the schedule to implement a fluoridation program pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of Section 116410 and funds are not offered pursuant to a binding contractual offer to the public water system sufficient to pay the capital and associated costs from any outside source. As used in this section, “outside source” means a source other than the system’s ratepayers, shareholders, local taxpayers, bondholders, or any fees or charges levied by the water system.

(B) If the public water system has been offered pursuant to a binding contractual offer the capital and associated funds necessary for fluoridation as set forth in subparagraph (A) and has completed the installation of a fluoridation system, however, in any given fiscal year (July 1-June 30, inclusive) funding is not available to the public water system sufficient to pay the noncapital operation and maintenance costs described in subdivision (g) from any outside source other than the system’s ratepayers, shareholders, local taxpayers, bondholders, or any fees or charges levied by the water system. A binding contractual offer to provide funds for 12 months, without regard to fiscal year, of noncapital operation and maintenance costs shall render a water system unqualified for an exemption under this subparagraph for that year.

(C) If the funding provided by an outside source for capital and associated costs is depleted prior to completion of the installation of a fluoridation system and funds sufficient to complete the installation have not been offered pursuant to a binding contractual offer to the public water system by an outside source. In the event of a disagreement between the public water system and an outside funding source about the reasonableness of additional capital and associated costs, in order to qualify for an exemption under this subparagraph the costs overruns must be found to be reasonable by a registered civil engineer recognized or employed by the department who is familiar with the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of fluoridation systems.

(2) Each year the department shall prepare and distribute a list of those water systems that do not qualify for exemption under this section from the fluoridation requirements of Section 116410. This list shall include water systems that have been offered, have received, or are expected to receive, sufficient funding for capital and associated costs so as to not qualify for exemption under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1), and have either (A) been offered or have received, or anticipate receiving, sufficient noncapital maintenance and operation funding pursuant to subdivision (g), or (B) have not yet completed the installation of a fluoridation system, so that they do not qualify for exemption under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1).

(3) Any water system that has been offered pursuant to a binding contractual offer the funds necessary for fluoridation as set forth in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1), and is not included in the list pursuant to paragraph (2), may elect to exercise the option not to fluoridate during the following fiscal year pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) by so notifying the department by certified mail on or before June 1.

(4) The permit issued by the department for a public water system that is scheduled to implement fluoridation pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of Section 116410 shall specify whether it is required to fluoridate pursuant to Section 116410, or whether it has been granted an exemption pursuant to either subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1).

(b) The department shall enforce Section 116410 and this section, and all regulations adopted pursuant to these sections, unless delegated pursuant to a local primary agreement.

(c) If the owner or operator of any public water system subject to Section 116410 fails, or refuses, to comply with any regulations adopted pursuant to Section 116410, or any order of the department implementing these regulations, the Attorney General shall, upon the request of the department, institute mandamus proceedings, or other appropriate proceedings, in order to compel compliance with the order, rule, or regulation. This remedy shall be in addition to all other authorized remedies or sanctions.

(d) Neither this section nor Section 116410 shall supersede subdivision (b) of Section 116410.

(e) The department shall seek all sources of funding for enforcement of the standards and capital cost requirements established pursuant to this section and Section 116410, including, but not limited to, all of the following:

(1) Federal block grants.

(2) Donations from private foundations.

Expenditures from governmental sources shall be subject to specific appropriation by the Legislature for these purposes.

(f) A public water system with less than 10,000 service connections may elect to comply with the standards, compliance requirements, and regulations for fluoridation established pursuant to this section and Section 116410.

(g) Costs, other than capital costs, incurred in complying with this section and Section 116410, including regulations adopted pursuant to those sections, may be paid from federal grants, or donations from private foundations, for these purposes. Each public water system that will incur costs, other than capitalization costs, as a result of compliance with this section and Section 116410, shall provide an estimate to the department of the anticipated total annual operations and maintenance costs related to fluoridation treatment by January 1 of each year.

(h) A public water system subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission shall be entitled to recover from its customers all of its capital and associated costs, and all of its operation and maintenance expenses associated with compliance with this section and Section 116410. The Public Utilities Commission shall approve rate increases for an owner or operator of a public water system that is subject to its jurisdiction within 45 days of the filing of an application or an advice letter, in accordance with the commission’s requirements, showing in reasonable detail the amount of additional revenue required to recover the foregoing capital and associated costs, and operation and maintenance expenses.

(a) The state board, after providing notice to the permittee and opportunity for a hearing, may suspend or revoke any permit issued pursuant to this chapter if the state board determines pursuant to the hearing that the permittee is not complying with the permit, this chapter, or any regulation, standard, or order issued or adopted thereunder, or that the permittee has made a false statement or representation on any application, record, or report maintained or submitted for purposes of compliance with this chapter. If the permittee does not request a hearing within the period specified in the notice, the state board may suspend or revoke the permit without a hearing. If the permittee submits a timely request for a hearing, the hearing shall be before the state board or a member of the state board, in accordance with Section 183 of the Water Code and the rules for adjudicative proceedings adopted under Section 185 of the Water Code. If the permit at issue has been temporarily suspended pursuant to subdivision (b), the notice shall be provided within 15 days of the effective date of the temporary suspension order. The commencement of the hearing under this subdivision shall be as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the effective date of the temporary suspension order, unless the state board grants an extension of the 60 day period upon request of the permittee.

(b) The state board may temporarily suspend any permit issued pursuant to this chapter before any hearing when the action is necessary to prevent an imminent or substantial danger to health. The state board shall notify the permittee of the temporary suspension and the effective date of the temporary suspension and, at the same time, notify the permittee that a hearing has been scheduled. The hearing shall be held as soon as possible, but not later than 15 days after the effective date of the temporary suspension unless the state board grants an extension of the 15-day period upon request of the permittee, and shall deal only with the issue of whether the temporary suspension shall remain in place pending a hearing under subdivision (a). The hearing shall be conducted under the rules for adjudicative proceedings adopted by the state board under Section 185 of the Water Code. The temporary suspension shall remain in effect until the hearing under this subdivision is completed and the state board has made a final determination on the temporary suspension, which shall be made within 15 days after the completion of the hearing unless the state board grants an extension of the 15-day period upon request of the permittee. If the determination is not transmitted within 15 days after the hearing is completed, or any extension of this period requested by the permittee, the temporary suspension shall be of no further effect. Dissolution of the temporary suspension does not deprive the state board of jurisdiction to proceed with a hearing on the merits under subdivision (a).

(10) (A) Hold at least one public meeting at the initiation of this process in a place as close as feasible to the affected areas. The state board shall make reasonable efforts to provide a 30-day notice of the meeting to the ratepayers, renters, and property owners to receive water service through service extension or in the area of the subsumed water system and all affected local government agencies and drinking water service providers. The 30-day notice shall include information about water quality concerns in the area, relevant information about health effects of water contaminants, and information about opportunities for consolidation or extension of service to address water quality issues. The meeting shall provide representatives of the potentially subsumed water system, affected ratepayers, renters, property owners, the potentially receiving water system, and the public an opportunity to present oral and written comments.

(B) The state board shall provide an opportunity to submit comments by mail or electronically during the notice period and for at least one week after the meeting.

(C) The state board shall review comments received during the meeting and received by mail and electronically during the notice period and for one week after the public meeting.

(11) If the potentially subsumed water system to be consolidated into the receiving water system is an at-risk water system, the state board shall do all of the following:

(A) Conduct outreach to ratepayers and residents served by the at-risk water system, including identifiable local community groups. These outreach efforts shall gauge community support for consolidation of the at-risk water system. The state board shall consider the results of this outreach when deciding whether to order consolidation of the at-risk water system.

(B) Consider any petition submitted pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) by members of a disadvantaged community served by the at-risk water system.

(C) (i) If the potentially subsumed water system contends during the initial written comment period set forth in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (10) that it is not an at-risk water system, the state board shall consider during a public meeting any information provided by the potentially subsumed water system in support of its contention that it is not an at-risk water system.

(ii) The state board shall make reasonable efforts to provide a 30-day notice of the public meeting described in clause (i) to the ratepayers, renters, and property owners to receive water service through service extension or in the area of the subsumed water system and all affected local government agencies and drinking water service providers.

(c) If a consolidation or other means of providing an adequate supply of safe drinking water has not been negotiated by the potentially receiving water system and the potentially subsumed water system before the expiration of the deadline set by the state board pursuant to paragraph (8) of subdivision (b), the state board shall do the following:

(1) Consult with the potentially receiving water system and the potentially subsumed water system, if any.

(2) (A) If the consolidation has not concluded within six months following the first public meeting held pursuant to paragraph (10) of subdivision (b), conduct a public meeting in a location as close as feasible to the affected communities. The meeting shall be held after the state board has made the findings described in subdivision (d).

(B) The state board shall make reasonable efforts to provide a 30-day notice of the meeting to the ratepayers, renters, property owners to receive water service through service extension or in the area of the subsumed water system, and the public, and to all affected local government agencies and drinking water service providers.

(C) The meeting shall provide representatives of the potentially subsumed water system, affected ratepayers, renters, property owners, and the potentially receiving water system an opportunity to present oral and written comments.

(D) The meeting shall provide an opportunity for public comment.

(3) The state board shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that a receiving water system and a subsumed water system are informed on a regular basis of progress regarding actions taken pursuant to this section.

(d) Before ordering consolidation or extension of service, the state board shall find all of the following:

(1) The potentially subsumed water system has consistently failed to provide an adequate supply of safe drinking water or it is at risk of doing so, as determined by the state board.

(2) Reasonable efforts to negotiate consolidation or extension of service were made.

(3) Consolidation of the receiving water system and subsumed water system or extension of service is appropriate and technically and economically feasible. In making this finding, the state board shall consider how many owners of dwelling units served by domestic wells in the service area have provided, or are likely to provide, written consent to extension of service. The state board need not find that any specific percentage of the owners of dwelling units served by domestic wells in the service area are likely to consent to the consolidation or extension of service to serve their dwelling unit.

(4) There is no pending local agency formation commission process that is likely to resolve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.

(5) Concerns regarding water rights and water contracts of the subsumed and receiving water systems have been adequately addressed.

(6) Consolidation or extension of service is an effective and cost-effective means to provide an adequate supply of safe drinking water.

(7) The capacity of the proposed interconnection needed to accomplish the consolidation is limited to serving the current customers of the subsumed water system, infill sites within the community served by the subsumed water system, residents of disadvantaged communities in existence as of the date of consolidation and that are located along the service line connecting the subsumed water system and the receiving water system, and vacant lots within the community served by the subsumed water system that are zoned to allow residential use and have no more than one other vacant lot between that parcel and an infill parcel, including capacity needed for services such as firefighting.

(e) Upon ordering consolidation or extension of service, the state board shall do all of the following:

(1) As necessary and appropriate, as determined by the state board, compensate the receiving water system for any capacity lost as a result of the consolidation or extension of service either by paying the water system’s capacity charge set out in the water system’s adopted rate structure or by providing additional capacity needed as a result of the consolidation or extension of service, and by paying legal fees. When the receiving water system is compensated for capacity lost by payment of a capacity charge, the capacity charge shall be paid only to the extent that it does not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the service in accordance with Section 66013 of the Government Code. If capacity beyond what is needed for consolidation is provided by a project funded through the state board, the state board shall retain an option to use that capacity for future consolidations, without paying additional capacity charges, for five years, unless it releases that option in writing. Funding pursuant to this paragraph is available for the general purpose of providing financial assistance for the infrastructure needed for the consolidation or extension of service and does not need to be specific to each individual consolidation project. The state board shall provide appropriate financial assistance for the water infrastructure needed for the consolidation or extension of service. The state board’s existing financial assistance guidelines and policies shall be the basis for the financial assistance.

(2) Ensure payment of standard local agency formation commission fees caused by state board-ordered consolidation or extension of service.

(3) Adequately compensate the owners of a privately owned subsumed water system for the fair market value of the system, as determined by the Public Utilities Commission or the state board.

(4) Coordinate with the appropriate local agency formation commission and other relevant local agencies to facilitate the change of organization or reorganization.

(5) If ordering consolidation or extension of service between two water systems, consider any existing domestic wells within the service area that could also be subject to consolidation or extension of service pursuant to this section.

(6) If ordering consolidation or extension of service to a community containing residences served by domestic wells, promptly take all reasonable steps to obtain written consent to the consolidation or extension of service from an owner of each residence served by a domestic well.

(f) If funds are appropriated for this purpose, the state board may make funds available for the purposes of subdivision (e), as necessary and appropriate, to the receiving water system, the subsumed water system, or an administrator providing full oversight of construction or development projects related to a consolidation or extension of service.

(g) (1) For purposes of this section, fees, charges, and terms and conditions that may be imposed on new and existing customers of a receiving water system shall be subject to the following limitations:

(A) The consolidated water system shall not increase charges on existing customers of the receiving water system solely as a consequence of the consolidation or extension of service unless the customers receive a corresponding benefit.

(B) Except as provided in paragraph (2), fees or charges imposed on a customer of a subsumed water system shall not exceed the costs of the service.

(C) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the receiving water system shall not charge any fees to, or place conditions on, customers of the subsumed water system that it does not charge to, or impose on, new customers that are not subject to the consolidation with the receiving water system.

(2) (A) Notwithstanding subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (1), if costs incurred by the receiving water system in completing the consolidation or extension of service are not otherwise recoverable as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the receiving water system may charge fees to customers of the subsumed water system to recover those costs.

(B) A receiving water system shall not charge a fee pursuant to subparagraph (A) for costs that are otherwise recoverable from the state, the federal government, programs administered by local agencies, parties responsible for causing contamination that the consolidation or extension of service is designed to address, or other sources, as determined by the state board.

(h) The state board shall not, pursuant to this section, fund public works or upgrades unrelated to the delivery of an adequate supply of affordable, safe drinking water, including, but not limited to, the installation of streetlights, sidewalks, curbs, and gutters. A local agency’s decision whether to provide these public works or upgrades shall not delay the consolidation or extension of service.

(i) When a public water system is operated by a local educational agency, the state board may order a receiving water system to consolidate or extend service to a public water system operated by a local educational agency pursuant to this section if both the following additional conditions are met:

(1) The local educational agency serves students from one or more census blocks that are disadvantaged communities.

(2) The state board obtains a written determination from the local educational agency that the state board’s analysis in the financing package, developed pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (8) of subdivision (b), indicates that consolidating or extending service would not result in additional unacceptable costs to the local educational agency and would result in safe drinking water being available to the local educational agency.

(j) (1) An order pursuant to this section shall not require consolidation or extension of service to a residence served solely by a domestic well until an owner of the affected residence provides written consent to the consolidation or extension of service.

(2) Any owner of a domestic well that is located within the consolidation or extended service area who does not provide written consent shall be ineligible, until the consent is provided, for any future water-related grant funding from the state other than funding to mitigate a well failure, disaster, or other emergency.

(3) (A) Notwithstanding any other law, any owner of a domestic well that serves a rental property and is located within the consolidation or extended service area who does not provide written consent shall ensure that tenants of rental properties served solely by that domestic well have access to an adequate supply of safe drinking water and, until consent is provided, shall do all of the following:

(i) Once per year, test the drinking water from domestic wells subject to subparagraph (A). Testing shall be conducted for all contaminants for which the state board has adopted primary and secondary drinking water standards and conducted pursuant to Section 64534 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, and any revisions to those regulations.

(ii) Provide the results from the testing to all tenants within 10 days of receiving those results. The notice shall comply with subdivisions (a) and (d) of Section 64465 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, and any revisions to those regulations, and shall be provided in English and the primary language spoken by the tenant recipient.

(iii) Provide the test results to the local health officer or other relevant health agency.

(B) If the testing results collected pursuant to subparagraph (A) demonstrate a violation of any primary or secondary drinking water standards adopted by the state board, the domestic well owner shall provide or pay for uninterrupted replacement water service, which may include wellhead treatment.

(C) If wellhead treatment is used to meet the requirement of subparagraph (B), the domestic well owner shall do both of the following:

(i) Conduct testing pursuant to Section 64534 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, and any revisions to those regulations, to determine if, subsequent to wellhead treatment, water from the domestic well meets primary and secondary drinking water standards adopted by the state board.

(ii) Provide the test results to tenants pursuant to clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) and to the local health officer or other relevant health agency.

(D) An owner of a domestic well shall not impose any charge, or increase any fee, rent, or other charge imposed, on any tenant solely as a result of the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C).

(E) The requirements of this paragraph shall apply to consolidations ordered by the state board pursuant to this section, and to voluntary consolidations negotiated between a receiving water system and a subsumed water system, subsequent to encouragement to consolidate by the state board pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b).

(F) The state board shall enforce this paragraph if the Legislature has appropriated sufficient funds in the annual Budget Act or otherwise for that purpose.

(k) A finding that a disadvantaged community, in whole or in part, is substantially reliant on at-risk domestic wells shall be based on the maps created pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 116772 and inspection or testing of the domestic wells showing an imminent risk of failing to provide an adequate supply of safe drinking water.

(l) The state board may prioritize consolidation of an at-risk water system that has historically been overburdened by pollution and industrial development or faced other environmental justice hurdles.

(m) Division 3 (commencing with Section 56000) of Title 5 of the Government Code does not apply to an action taken by the state board pursuant to this section.

###### 116760.10.



(a) Because the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 300j et seq.) provides for establishment of a perpetual drinking water revolving fund, which will be partially capitalized by federal contributions, it is in the interest of the people of the state, in order to ensure full participation by the state under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, to enact this chapter to authorize the state to establish and implement a state drinking water revolving fund that will meet federal conditions for receipt of federal funds. The primary purpose of this chapter is to enable receipt of funds under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. It is the intent of the Legislature that the terms of this chapter shall be liberally construed to achieve this purpose.

(b) Toxic contaminants and new pathogenic organisms, including cryptosporidium, have been discovered in many of California’s public drinking water systems.

(c) Many of the contaminants in California’s drinking water supplies are known to cause, or are suspected of causing, cancer, birth defects, and other serious illnesses.

(d) It is unlikely that the contamination problems of small public water systems can be solved without financial assistance from the state.

(e) The protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of California requires that the water supplied for domestic purposes be at all times pure, wholesome, and potable. It is in the interest of the people that the State of California provide technical and financial assistance to ensure a safe, dependable, and potable supply of water for domestic purposes and that water is available in adequate quantity at sufficient pressure for health, cleanliness, and other domestic purposes.

(f) It is the intent of the Legislature to provide for the upgrading of existing public water supply systems to ensure that all domestic water supplies meet safe drinking water standards and other requirements established under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 116270).

(g) The extent of the current risk to public health from contamination in drinking water creates a compelling need to upgrade existing public water systems. The demand for financial assistance to enable public water systems to meet drinking water standards and regulations exceeds funds available from the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.

(h) The Legislature further finds and declares that regional solutions to water contamination problems are often more effective, efficient, and economical than solutions designed to address solely the problems of a single small public water system, and it is in the interest of the people of the State of California to encourage the consolidation of the management and the facilities of small water systems to enable those systems to better address their water contamination problems.

(i) The protection of drinking water sources is essential to ensuring that the people of California are provided with pure, wholesome, and potable drinking water.

(j) That coordination among local, state, and federal public health and environmental management programs be undertaken to ensure that sources of drinking water are protected while avoiding duplication of effort and reducing program costs.

(k) It is necessary that a source water protection program be implemented for the purposes of delineating, assessing, and protecting drinking water sources throughout the state and that federal funds be utilized pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to carry out that program.

(l) It is in the interest of the people of the state to provide funds for a perpetual Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund that may be combined with similar federal funding to the extent the funding is authorized pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.

(m) This chapter shall govern implementation of the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, and shall be implemented in a manner that is consistent with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, and, to the extent authorized under the federal act, in a manner that is consistent with the California Safe Drinking Water Act, Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 116270).

(n) This section shall become operative on July 1, 2014.

_(Repealed (in Sec. 64) and added by Stats. 2014, Ch. 35, Sec. 65. (SB 861) Effective June 20, 2014. Section operative July 1, 2014, by its own provisions.)_

###### 116765.



The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) Every Californian should enjoy the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards. Every community should be a healthy environment in which to live, work, play, and learn.

(b) No single group of people should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences and adverse health impacts arising from industrial, governmental, or commercial operations or policies.

(c) Concentrated environmental contamination in water creates cumulative health burdens resulting in communities with higher rates of disease such as asthma, heart disease, cancer, neurological and reproductive health effects, birth defects, and obesity.

(d) Despite significant improvements in environmental protection over the past several decades, millions of Californians continue to live, work, play, and go to school in unhealthy environments.

(e) California was one of the first states in the nation to put environmental justice considerations into law and defines environmental justice as the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.

(f) California law also declares that it is the established policy of the state that every human being has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes.

(g) Yet, still more than 1,000,000 Californians do not have access to safe drinking water. In communities where the sole water supply is contaminated with substances like arsenic, manganese, nitrates, or hexavalent chromium, families are often left without safe water. The central valley and central coast regions, where more than 90% of the communities rely on groundwater as a primary source of drinking water, are particularly at risk, but other communities around the state are also at risk. More than 250,000 people in the central valley alone lack access to a consistent source of safe, affordable water.

(h) The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 lists lead, arsenic, and hexavalent chromium as substances that can cause cancer and reproductive toxicity.

(i) Established state environmental justice laws and policies are only effective insofar as they result in true parity.

(j) It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of California bring true environmental justice to our state and begin to address the continuing disproportionate environmental burdens in the state by creating a fund to provide safe drinking water in every California community, for every Californian.

(k) Climate change is exacerbating the water impacts on disadvantaged and environmentally burdened communities by reducing surface water flows, accelerating declining groundwater basins, and contributing to increasing concentrations of environmental contamination.

(l) Enhancing the long-term sustainability of drinking water systems in disadvantaged and environmentally burdened communities increases those communities’ resilience to climate change.

(m) Funding for safe and affordable drinking water under this chapter promotes investments in disadvantaged communities, provides important contributions to those communities in adapting to climate change, and is an appropriate expenditure from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund created pursuant to Section 16428.8 of the Government Code.

(n) It is the intent of the Legislature that the state board, in developing the fund expenditure plan pursuant to Article 4 (commencing with Section 116768), strive to ensure all regions of the state receive the same level of consideration for funding pursuant to this chapter, to the extent practicable.

(5) The development, implementation, and sustainability of long-term drinking water solutions.

(6) Board costs associated with the implementation and administration of programs pursuant to this chapter.

(b) Consistent with subdivision (a), the board shall expend moneys in the fund for grants, loans, contracts, or services to assist eligible recipients.

(2) Any waiver of tribal sovereign immunity that is required by the board for a tribe that is an eligible recipient to access funding under this chapter shall be narrowly drafted to serve both the individual needs of the tribe and make the funding agreement enforceable. The waiver of sovereign immunity shall be negotiated with the direct involvement and assistance of the board’s tribal liaison or their designee or designees.

(3) In order to facilitate better coordination between the board and tribes that are eligible recipients, the board shall include its designated tribal liaison or their designee or designees in all discussions with eligible recipients, unless those eligible recipients give permission for the tribal liaison or their designee or designees to be absent.

(4) In expending moneys from the fund under this chapter, the board shall consider the extent that funds for safe drinking water projects from the programs administered by the board are distributed to eligible recipients to provide assistance to federally recognized California Native American tribes or nonfederally recognized Native American tribes on the contact list maintained by the Native American Heritage Commission for the purposes of Chapter 905 of the Statutes of 2004 and shall make diligent efforts to ensure the distribution of funds to those tribes. The board shall expend those funds, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for grants, loans, contracts, or services to assist those tribes.

(5) The board shall post on its internet website, and update annually, the number of inquiries for funding received from tribes, the number of applications for funding received from tribes, and the total amount of funding granted to tribes each year. If the board is not able to consistently approve funding applications from eligible tribes in a timely manner, the board shall identify barriers to the tribes receiving funding and propose possible solutions in the fund expenditure plan.

(6) To be eligible for funding under this chapter, grants, loans, contracts, or services provided to a public utility that is regulated by the Public Utilities Commission or a mutual water company shall have a clear and definite public purpose and shall benefit the customers of the water system and not the investors.

(7) For purposes of this subdivision, “tribal liaison” means an individual employed by the board as a tribal liaison, or if the tribal liaison is unavailable, a tribal coordinator, the board’s chair, the board’s executive director, or the board’s chief counsel acting in that capacity as a designee or the designees of the tribal liaison.

(d) On and after July 1, 2020, an expenditure from the fund shall be consistent with the fund expenditure plan.

(e) The board may expend moneys from the fund for reasonable costs associated with the administration of this chapter, not to exceed 5 percent of the annual deposits into the fund.

(f) In administering the fund, the board shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that funds are used to secure the long-term sustainability of drinking water service and infrastructure, including, but not limited to, requiring adequate technical, managerial, and financial capacity of eligible applicants as part of funding agreement outcomes.

(g) Beginning in the 2023–24 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter until June 30, 2030, if the annual transfer to the fund pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 39719 is less than one hundred thirty million dollars ($130,000,000), on an annual basis the Director of Finance shall calculate a sum equivalent to the difference, up to one hundred thirty million dollars ($130,000,000), and the Controller shall transfer that sum from the General Fund to the fund. This subdivision is operative only while a market-based compliance mechanism adopted pursuant to Section 38562 is operative.

(h) The board may authorize funding up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) without a written agreement to address a drinking water emergency.

(i) Notwithstanding Section 11019 of the Government Code, the board may make advance payments, as necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter, except that an advance payment for construction shall not exceed 25 percent of the total amount of construction funding provided by the board for a project.

(j) Contracts pursuant to this section are exempt from Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 10290) of Part 2 of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code and Section 4526 of the Government Code, and may be awarded on a noncompetitive bid basis as necessary to implement the purposes of this section.

###### 116775.



The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the utilization of the waters of the state by residential consumers for general domestic purposes, including drinking, cleaning, washing, and personal grooming and sanitation of the people is a right that should be interfered with only when necessary for specified health and safety purposes or to protect the quality of the waters of the state. The Legislature further finds that variation in water quality, and particularly in water hardness, throughout the state often requires that onsite water softening or conditioning be available to domestic consumers to ensure their right to a water supply that is effective and functional for domestic requirements of the residential household, but that residential water softening or conditioning appliances shall be available only as authorized in this article.

_(Amended by Stats. 1999, Ch. 969, Sec. 1. Effective January 1, 2000.)_

###### 116780.



(a)  Unless the context otherwise requires the definitions in this section govern the construction of this article.

(b)  “Clock control” means the system controlling the periodic automatic regeneration of a residential water softening or conditioning appliance that is based upon a predetermined and preset time schedule.

(c)  “Demand control” means the system controlling the periodic automatic regeneration of a residential water softening or conditioning appliance that is based either upon a sensor that detects imminent exhaustion of the active softening or conditioning material or upon the measurement of the volume of water passing through the appliance. A demand control system activates regeneration based upon the state of the equipment and its ability to continue the softening process.

(d)  “Fully manual regeneration” means the method of regeneration of a residential water softening or conditioning appliance in which operations are performed manually and in which dry salt is added directly to the ion-exchanger tank after sufficient water is removed to make room for the salt.

(e)  “Hardness” means the total of all dissolved calcium, magnesium, iron and other heavy metal salts, that interact with soaps and detergents in a manner that the efficiency of soaps and detergents for cleansing purposes is impaired. Hardness is expressed in grains per gallon or milligrams per liter as if all such salts were present as calcium carbonate.

(f)  “Local agency” means a city, county, city and county, district, or any other political subdivision of the state.

(g)  “Manually initiated control” means the system controlling the periodic regeneration of a residential water softening or conditioning appliance in which all operations, including bypass of hard water and return to service, are performed automatically after manual initiation.

(h)  “Regeneration” means the phase of operation of a water softening or conditioning appliance whereby the capability of the appliance to remove hardness from water is renewed by the application of a brine solution of sodium or potassium chloride salt to the active softening or conditioning material contained therein followed by a subsequent rinsing of the active softening or conditioning material.

(i)  “Salt efficiency rating” means the efficiency of the use of sodium chloride salt in the regeneration of a water softening appliance, expressed in terms of hardness removal capacity of the appliance per pound of salt used in the regeneration process. The units of salt efficiency rating are grains of hardness removed per pound of salt used. One grain of hardness per gallon is approximately equivalent to 17.1 milligrams of hardness per liter.

_(Amended by Stats. 1999, Ch. 969, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 2000.)_

(b)  The regeneration of the appliance discharges to the community sewer system and all of the following conditions are satisfied:

(1)  The appliance activates regeneration by demand control.

(2)  An appliance installed on or after January 1, 2000, shall be certified by a third party rating organization using industry standards to have a salt efficiency rating of no less than 3,350 grains of hardness removed per pound of salt used in regeneration. An appliance installed on or after January 1, 2002, shall be certified by a third party rating organization using industry standards to have a salt efficiency rating of no less than 4,000 grains of hardness removed per pound of salt used in regeneration.

(3)  The installation of the appliance is accompanied by the simultaneous installation of the following softened or conditioned water conservation devices on all fixtures using softened or conditioned water, unless the devices are already in place or are prohibited by local and state plumbing and building standards or unless the devices will adversely restrict the normal operation of the fixtures:

(A)  Faucet flow restrictors.

(B)  Shower head restrictors.

(C)  Toilet reservoir dams.

(D)  A piping system installed so that untreated (unsoftened or unconditioned) supply water is carried to hose bibs and sill cocks that serve water to the outside of the house, except that bypass valves may be installed on homes with slab foundations constructed prior to the date of installation; or condominiums constructed prior to the date of installation; or otherwise where a piping system is physically inhibited.

This part shall be known and may be cited as the Medical Waste Management Act.

_(Added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 1996.)_

###### 117605.



(a) This part governs medical waste management at the facility where waste is generated, at transfer stations, and at treatment facilities. This part also governs the tracking of medical waste beyond what is required in federal shipping documents and regulates aspects of the transport of regulated medical waste.

(b) Sections 173.196 and 173.197 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations impose standards for the transportation of medical waste on public roads and highways while in transport, unless an affected person applies to, and receives a determination of any perceived conflict from, the United States Secretary of Transportation. Domestic Mail Manual 601.10.17.5 (Mailability: Hazardous Materials: Sharps and Other Mailable Regulated Medical Waste) imposes standards for the transportation of medical waste through the mail and approves medical waste mail back systems.

(c) The department shall submit to the Legislature by no later than January 1, 2016, a report describing the interaction of federal and state law for the transport of regulated medical waste. The department shall convene a stakeholder group that includes, but is not limited to, small and large quantity generators, haulers, transfer station operators, treatment facility operators, local enforcement agencies, retailers, and other affected entities for this purpose. The reporting requirement imposed by this subdivision shall expire as of January 1, 2016, or when the report is submitted to the Legislature. The report submitted pursuant to this section shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.

(d) The department may, in its discretion, update standards related to the transportation of medical waste during transit through a guidance document provided to regulated entities and posted on the department’s Internet Web site. This guidance document shall be exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) to the extent that the department finds that the updated standards are consistent with the standards of the United States Department of Transportation.

(e) If an affected person, including the department, seeks a preemption determination pursuant to Section 5125 of Title 49 of the United States Code or by a court of competent jurisdiction, the department may, in its discretion, temporarily waive the state transportation requirements under this part until that determination is made and shall provide notice of the waiver on its Internet Web site.

(f) During the period of temporary waiver described in subdivision (e), or if preemption is found, the federal requirements shall be deemed to be the law of this state and enforceable by the department. The department may enforce these federal requirements by providing an updated guidance document to interested parties and posting the updated guidance document on the department’s Internet Web site.

(g) The Medical Waste Management Act does not preempt any local ordinance regulating infectious waste, as that term was defined by Section 25117.5 as it read on December 31, 1990, if the ordinance was in effect on January 1, 1990, and regulated both large and small quantity generators. Any ordinance may be amended in a manner that is consistent with this part.

(a) Whenever the enforcement agency determines that a violation or threatened violation of this part or the regulations adopted pursuant to this part has resulted, or is likely to result, in a release of medical waste into the environment, the agency may issue an order to the responsible person specifying a schedule for compliance or imposing an administrative penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) per violation. A person who, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, violates an order issued pursuant to this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.

(1) If the department is the enforcement agency, the department shall provide notice, issue the order, and conduct the administrative hearing pursuant to subdivisions (d) and (f).

(2) If the department is not the enforcement agency, the provisions of subdivisions (b) to (e), inclusive, apply.

(b) (1) In establishing the amount of the administrative penalty and ordering that the violation be corrected pursuant to this section, the enforcement agency shall take into consideration the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the violator’s past and present efforts to prevent, abate, or clean up conditions posing a threat to the public health or safety or the environment, the violator’s ability to pay the penalty, and the deterrent effect that the imposition of the penalty would have on both the violator and the regulated community.

(2) If the amount of the administrative penalty is set after the person is served with the order pursuant to subdivision (c) or after the order becomes final, the person may request a hearing to dispute the amount of the administrative penalty and is entitled to the same process as provided in subdivision (c), whether or not the person disputed the facts of the violation through that process.

(c) (1) An order issued pursuant to this section shall be served by personal service or certified mail and shall inform the person served of the right to a hearing.

(2) A person served with an order pursuant to paragraph (1) and who has been unable to resolve the violation with the enforcement agency may, within 15 days after service of the order, request a hearing by filing with the enforcement agency a notice of defense. The notice shall be filed with the agency that issued the order. A notice of defense shall be deemed filed within the 15-day period if it is postmarked within that 15-day period. If no notice of defense is filed within the 15-day time period, the order shall become final.

(3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (4), a person requesting a hearing on an order issued pursuant to this section may select the hearing officer specified in either subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (4) in the notice of defense filed with the enforcement agency pursuant to paragraph (2). If a notice of defense is filed, but no hearing officer is selected, the enforcement agency may select the hearing officer.

(4) Within 90 days of receipt of the notice of defense by the enforcement agency, the hearing shall be scheduled using one of the following:

(A) An administrative law judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings of the Department of General Services, who shall conduct the hearing in accordance with Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 11400) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, and the enforcement agency shall have all the authority granted to an agency by those provisions.

(B) (i) A hearing officer designated by the enforcement agency, who shall conduct the hearing in accordance with Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 11400) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, and the enforcement agency shall have all the authority granted to an agency by those provisions. When a hearing is conducted by an enforcement agency hearing officer pursuant to this clause, the enforcement agency shall issue a decision within 60 days after the hearing is conducted. Each hearing officer designated by an enforcement agency shall meet the requirements of Section 11425.30 of the Government Code and any other applicable restriction.

(ii) An enforcement agency, or a person requesting a hearing on an order issued by an enforcement agency, may select the hearing process specified in this subparagraph in a notice of defense filed pursuant to paragraph (2) only if the enforcement agency has selected a designated hearing officer and established a program for conducting a hearing in accordance with this paragraph.

(5) The hearing decision issued pursuant to this subdivision shall be effective and final upon issuance by the enforcement agency. A copy of the decision shall be served by personal service or by certified mail upon the party served with the order, or their representative, if any.

(6) The person has a right to appeal the hearing decision if, within 30 days of the date of receipt of the final decision pursuant to paragraph (5), the person files a written notice of appeal with the enforcement agency. The appeal shall be in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapters 4.5 (commencing with Section 11400) and 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).

(7) A decision issued pursuant to paragraph (6) may be reviewed by a court pursuant to Section 11523 of the Government Code. In all proceedings pursuant to this subdivision, the court shall uphold the decision of the enforcement agency if the decision is based upon substantial evidence in the record as a whole. The filing of a petition for writ of mandate shall not stay an action required pursuant to this chapter or the accrual of any penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter. This subdivision does not prohibit the court from granting any appropriate relief within its jurisdiction.

(d) A provision of an order issued under this section, except the imposition of an administrative penalty, shall take effect upon issuance of the order by the enforcement agency if the enforcement agency finds that the violation or violations of law associated with that provision may pose an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or safety or the environment. A request for a hearing or appeal, as provided in subdivision (c) or (f) shall not stay the effect of that provision of the order pending a hearing decision. If the enforcement agency determines that any or all provisions of the order are so related that the public health or safety or the environment can be protected only by immediate compliance with the order as a whole, the order as a whole, except the imposition of an administrative penalty, shall take effect upon issuance by the enforcement agency. A request for a hearing shall not stay the effect of the order as a whole pending a hearing decision.

(e) The enforcement agency shall consult with the district attorney, county counsel, or city attorney on the development of policies to be followed in exercising the authority delegated pursuant to this section as it relates to the authority of the enforcement agency to issue orders.

(f) (1) The department shall serve an order issued pursuant to this section by personal service or certified mail and shall inform the person served of the right to a hearing.

(2) A person served with an order pursuant to paragraph (1) may appeal the order by sending a written request for hearing to the department within 20 days after service of the order. If a request for hearing is not made within the 20-day time period, the order shall become final. Payments of any administrative penalty shall be made within 30 days of the date the order becomes final.

###### 118916.



(a) (1) The Legislature finds and declares that the use of smokeless tobacco products by professional baseball players is a matter of statewide interest and concern. It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to prohibit the use of smokeless tobacco products by professional baseball players in stadiums in this state.

(2) The Legislature further finds that there is a high level of smokeless tobacco use by Major League Baseball players, as well as a well-established role-model effect between professional baseball players and youth. A ban on the use of smokeless tobacco in professional baseball takes aim at the use of smokeless tobacco by professional baseball players at stadiums throughout California with the goal that impressionable youth never begin to use smokeless tobacco products or associate smokeless tobacco with the sport of baseball.

(3) To promote a healthy and active lifestyle and to set a better example for youth, the Legislature urges Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association to adopt a nationwide ban on the use of smokeless tobacco by players, managers, and coaches in public stadiums. Since 1993, minor league baseball has prohibited the use or possession of smokeless tobacco by players, coaches, and umpires on ballpark premises and during club travel.

(b) A person shall not use or possess a smokeless tobacco product at any time on the playing field of a baseball stadium.

(c) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:

(1) “Baseball stadium” means the physical area in which a professional baseball game or practice is occurring.

(2) “Playing field” means the area in which a baseball game is played, including a dugout, bullpen, and team bench area.

(3) “Professional baseball” means baseball games played in connection with Major League Baseball or minor league baseball.

(4) “Smokeless tobacco” means a product that contains cut, ground, powdered, or leaf tobacco and is intended to be placed in the oral or nasal cavity, including, but not limited to, snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, dissolvable tobacco products, and snus.

(d) This section sets forth minimum state restrictions on the use or possession of smokeless tobacco in a baseball stadium and does not preempt or otherwise prohibit the adoption of a local ordinance that imposes a more restrictive or complete ban on smokeless tobacco use and possession in a baseball stadium. A local ordinance that imposes a more restrictive or complete ban on smokeless tobacco use or possession in a baseball stadium shall control in the event of an inconsistency between this section and the local ordinance.

(e) The provisions of this section are severable. If any provision of this section or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.

(f) This section shall become operative on December 1, 2016.

_(Added by Stats. 2015, Ch. 779, Sec. 1. (AB 768) Effective January 1, 2016. Section operative December 1, 2016, by its own provisions.)_

###### 118920.



(a)  The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the United States Surgeon General’s 1986 Report on the Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking conclude all of the following:

(1)  Involuntary smoking is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers.

(2)  The children of parents who smoke compared with the children of nonsmoking parents have an increased frequency of respiratory infections, increased respiratory symptoms, and slightly smaller rates of increase in lung function as the lungs mature.

(3)  The simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to environmental tobacco smoke.

(b)  The Legislature further finds and declares the following:

(1)  Nonsmokers have no adequate means to protect themselves from the damage inflicted upon them when they involuntarily inhale tobacco smoke.

(2)  Regulation of smoking in public places is necessary to protect the health, safety, welfare, comfort, and environment of nonsmokers.

(c)  It is, therefore, the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this article, to eliminate smoking on public transportation vehicles.

###### 118950.



(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:

(1) Smoking is the single most important source of preventable disease and premature death in California.

(2) Smoking is responsible for one-quarter of all death caused by fire.

(3) Tobacco-related disease places a tremendous financial burden upon the persons with the disease, their families, the health care delivery system, and society as a whole.

(4) Despite laws in at least 44 states prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors, each day 3,000 children start using tobacco products in this nation. Children under the age of 18 years consume 947 million packages of cigarettes in this country yearly.

(5) The earlier a child begins to use tobacco products, the more likely it is that the child will be unable to quit.

(6) More than 60 percent of all smokers begin smoking by the age of 14 years, and 90 percent begin by the age of 19 years.

(7) Use of smokeless tobacco products among minors in this state is increasing.

(8) Smokeless tobacco or chewing tobacco is harmful to the health of individuals and may cause gum disease, mouth or oral cancers, increased tooth decay and leukoplakia.

(9) Tobacco product advertising and promotion are an important cause of tobacco use among children. More money is spent advertising and promoting tobacco products than any other consumer product.

(10) Distribution of tobacco product samples, coupons, coupon offers, gift certificates, gift cards, or other similar offers is a recognized source by which minors obtain tobacco products, beginning the addiction process.

(11) It is the intent of the Legislature that keeping children from beginning to use tobacco products in any form and encouraging all persons to quit tobacco use shall be among the highest priorities in disease prevention for the State of California.

(b) It is unlawful for any person, agent, or employee of a person in the business of selling or distributing smokeless tobacco or cigarettes to engage in the nonsale distribution of any smokeless tobacco or cigarettes to any person in any public building, park or playground, or on any public sidewalk, street, or other public grounds, or on any private property that is open to the general public.

(c) For purposes of this section:

(1) “Nonsale distribution” means to give smokeless tobacco or cigarettes to the general public at no cost, or at nominal cost, or to give coupons, coupon offers, gift certificates, gift cards, or other similar offers, or rebate offers for smokeless tobacco or cigarettes to the general public at no cost or at nominal cost. Distribution of tobacco products, coupons, coupon offers, gift certificates, gift cards, or other similar offers, or rebate offers in connection with the sale of another item, including tobacco products, cigarette lighters, magazines, or newspapers shall not constitute nonsale distribution.

(2)  “Smokeless tobacco” means (A) a loose or flat, compressed cake form of tobacco that may be chewed or held in the mouth or (B) a shredded, powdered, or pulverized form of tobacco that may be inhaled through the nostrils, chewed, or held in the mouth.

(3) “Public building, park, playground, sidewalk, street, or other public grounds” means any structure or outdoor area that is owned, operated, or maintained by any public entity, including, but not limited to: city and county streets and sidewalks, parade grounds, fair grounds, public transportation facilities and terminals, public reception areas, public health facilities, public recreational facilities, and public office buildings.

(4) “Private property that is open to the general public” means any structure or outdoor area that is owned, operated, or maintained by any private entity and that is open for entry or use by the general public, whether or not a fee or charge is imposed for entry or use.

(d) Any person who violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than two hundred dollars ($200) for one act, five hundred dollars ($500) for two acts, and one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each subsequent act constituting a violation. Each distribution of a single package, coupon, coupon offer, gift certificates, gift cards, or other similar offers, or rebate offer to an individual member of the general public in violation of this section shall be considered a separate violation.

(e) Neither this section nor any other provision of law shall invalidate an ordinance of, or prohibit the adoption of an ordinance by, a city or county regulating distribution of smokeless tobacco or cigarette samples within its boundaries that is more restrictive than this section. An ordinance that imposes greater restrictions on the sale or distribution of tobacco than this section shall govern, to the extent of any inconsistency between it and this section.

(f) Subdivisions (a) to (e), inclusive, do not apply to any public building, park, playground, sidewalk, street, or other public grounds, or any private property that is open to the general public where minors are prohibited by law. Subdivisions (a) to (e), inclusive, do not apply to any public building, park, playground, sidewalk, street, or other public grounds open to the general public and leased for private functions where minors are denied access by a peace officer or licensed security guard on the premises.

(g) Subdivisions (a) to (e), inclusive, do not apply to any private property that is open to the general public where minors are denied access to a separate nonsale distribution area by a peace officer or licensed security guard stationed at the entrance of the separate nonsale distribution area and the separate nonsale distribution area is enclosed so as to prevent persons outside the separate nonsale distribution area from seeing the nonsale distribution unless they undertake unreasonable efforts to see inside the area.

_( Chapter 3.5 added by Stats. 2002, Ch. 342, Sec. 1. )_

\


###### 120260.



(a)  The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1)  Early knowledge of infection with communicable disease is important in order to permit exposed persons to make informed health care decisions as well as to take measures to reduce the likelihood of transmitting the infection to others.

(2)  Individual health care providers, agents and employees of health care facilities and individual health care providers, and first responders, including police, firefighters, rescue personnel, and other persons who provide the first response to emergencies, frequently come into contact with the blood and other potentially infectious materials of individuals whose communicable disease infection status is not known.

(3)  Even if these exposed individuals use universal infection control precautions to prevent transmission of communicable diseases, there will be occasions when they experience significant exposure to the blood or other potentially infectious materials of patients.

(b)  Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide a narrow exposure notification and information mechanism to permit individual health care providers, the employees or contracted agents of health care facilities and individual health care providers, and first responders, who have experienced a significant exposure to the blood or other potentially infectious materials of a patient, to learn of the communicable disease infection status of the patient.

_(Added by Stats. 2002, Ch. 342, Sec. 1. Effective January 1, 2003.)_

###### 120260.5.

(3)  A registered nurse or licensed nurse practitioner who has been designated by the attending physician of the source patient.

(b)  “Available blood or patient sample” means blood or other tissue or material that was legally obtained in the course of providing health care services, and is in the possession of the physician or other health care provider of the source patient prior to the release of the source patient from the physician’s or health care provider’s facility.

(c)  “Certifying physician” means any physician consulted by the exposed individual for the exposure incident. A certifying physician shall have demonstrated competency and understanding of the then applicable guidelines or standards of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health.

(d)  “Communicable disease” means any disease that was transferable through the exposure incident, as determined by the certifying physician.

(e)  “Exposed individual” means any individual health care provider, first responder, or any other person, including, but not limited to, any employee, volunteer, or contracted agent of any health care provider, who is exposed, within the scope of his or her employment, to the blood or other potentially infectious materials of a source patient.

(i)  “Significant exposure” means direct contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials of a patient in a manner that, according to the then applicable guidelines of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, is capable of transmitting a communicable disease.

(j)  “Source patient” means any person receiving health care services whose blood or other potentially infectious material has been the source of a significant exposure to an exposed individual.

_(Added by Stats. 2002, Ch. 342, Sec. 1. Effective January 1, 2003.)_

###### 120262.



Notwithstanding Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 120975) or any other law, the blood or other tissue or material of a source patient may be tested, and an exposed individual may be informed whether the patient has tested positive or negative for a communicable disease if the exposed individual and the health care facility, if any, have substantially complied with the then applicable guidelines of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health and the State Department of Health Services and if the following procedure is followed:

(a)  (1)  If a person becomes an exposed individual by experiencing an exposure to the blood or other potentially infectious material of a patient during the course of rendering health care-related services or occupational services, the exposed individual may request an evaluation of the exposure by a physician to determine if it is a significant exposure, as defined in subdivision (h) of Section 120261. A physician or other exposed individual shall not certify his or her own significant exposure. However, an employing physician may certify the exposure of one of his or her employees. Requests for certification shall be made in writing within 72 hours of the exposure.

(2)  A written certification by a physician of the significance of the exposure shall be obtained within 72 hours of the request. The certification shall include the nature and extent of the exposure.

(b)  (1)  The exposed individual shall be counseled regarding the likelihood of transmission, the limitations of the testing performed, the need for followup testing, and the procedures that the exposed individual must follow regardless of whether the source patient has tested positive or negative for a communicable disease. The exposed individual may be tested in accordance with the then applicable guidelines or standards of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The result of this test shall be confirmed as negative before available blood or other patient samples of the source patient may be tested for evidence of infection to a communicable disease, without the consent of the source patient pursuant to subdivision (d).

(2)  Within 72 hours of certifying the exposure as significant, the certifying physician shall provide written certification to an attending physician of the source patient that a significant exposure to an exposed individual has occurred, and shall request information on whether the source patient has tested positive or negative for a communicable disease, and the availability of blood or other patient samples. An attending physician shall respond to the request for information within three working days.

(c)  If test results of the source patient are already known to be positive for a communicable disease then, except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 121010, when the exposed individual is a health care provider or an employee or agent of the health care provider of the source patient, an attending physician and surgeon of the source patient shall attempt to obtain the consent of the source patient to disclose to the exposed individual the testing results of the source patient regarding communicable diseases. If the source patient cannot be contacted or refuses to consent to the disclosure, then the exposed individual may be informed of the test results regarding communicable diseases of the source patient by an attending physician of the source patient as soon as possible after the exposure has been certified as significant, notwithstanding Section 120980 or any other law.

(d)  If the communicable disease status of the source patient is unknown to the certifying physician or an attending physician, if blood or other patient samples are available, and if the exposed individual has tested negative on a baseline test for communicable diseases, the source patient shall be given the opportunity to give informed consent to a test for communicable diseases in accordance with the following:

(1)  Within 72 hours after receiving a written certification of significant exposure, an attending physician of the source patient shall do all of the following:

(A)  Make a good faith effort to notify the source patient or the authorized legal representative of the source patient about the significant exposure. A good faith effort to notify includes, but is not limited to, a documented attempt to locate the source patient by telephone or by first-class mail with a certificate of mailing. An attempt to locate the source patient and the results of that attempt shall be documented in the medical record of the source patient. An inability to contact the source patient, or legal representative of the source patient, after a good faith effort to do so as provided in this subdivision, shall constitute a refusal of consent pursuant to paragraph (2). An inability of the source patient to provide informed consent shall constitute a refusal of consent pursuant to paragraph (2), provided all of the following conditions are met:

(i)  The source patient has no authorized legal representative.

(ii)  The source patient is incapable of giving consent.

(iii)  In the opinion of the attending physician, it is likely that the source patient will be unable to grant informed consent within the 72-hour period during which the physician is required to respond pursuant to paragraph (1).

(B)  Attempt to obtain the voluntary informed consent of the source patient or the authorized legal representative of the source patient to perform a test for a communicable disease, on the source patient or on any available blood or patient sample of the source patient. The voluntary informed consent shall be in writing. The source patient shall have the option not to be informed of the test result. An exposed individual shall be prohibited from attempting to obtain directly informed consent for testing for communicable diseases from the source patient.

(C)  Provide the source patient with medically appropriate pretest counseling and refer the source patient to appropriate posttest counseling and followup, if necessary. The source patient shall be offered medically appropriate counseling whether or not he or she consents to testing.

(2)  If the source patient or the authorized legal representative of the source patient refuses to consent to test for a communicable disease after a documented effort has been made to obtain consent, any available blood or patient sample of the source patient may be tested. The source patient or authorized legal representative of the source patient shall be informed that an available blood sample or other tissue or material will be tested despite his or her refusal, and that the exposed individual shall be informed of the test results regarding communicable diseases.

(3)  If the informed consent of the source patient cannot be obtained because the source patient is deceased, consent to perform a test for a communicable disease on any blood or patient sample of the source patient legally obtained in the course of providing health care services at the time of the exposure event shall be deemed granted.

(4)  A source patient or the authorized legal representative of a source patient shall be advised that he or she shall be informed of the results of the test for communicable diseases only if he or she wishes to be so informed. If a patient refuses to provide informed consent to testing for communicable diseases and refuses to learn the results of the testing, he or she shall sign a form documenting this refusal. The source patient’s refusal to sign this form shall be construed to be a refusal to be informed of the test results regarding communicable diseases. Test results for communicable diseases shall only be placed in the medical record when the patient has agreed in writing to be informed of the results.

(5)  Notwithstanding any other law, if the source patient or authorized legal representative of a source patient refuses to be informed of the results of the test, the test results regarding communicable diseases of that source patient shall only be provided to the exposed individual in accordance with the then applicable regulations established by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health.

(6)  The source patient’s identity shall be encoded on the communicable disease test result record.

(e)  If an exposed individual is informed of the status of a source patient with regard to a communicable disease pursuant to this section, the exposed individual shall be informed that he or she is subject to existing confidentiality protections for any identifying information about the communicable disease test results, and that medical information regarding the communicable disease status of the source patient shall be kept confidential and may not be further disclosed, except as otherwise authorized by law. The exposed individual shall be informed of the penalties for which he or she would be personally liable for violation of Section 120980.

(f)  The costs for the test and counseling for communicable diseases of the exposed individual, or the source patient, or both, shall be borne by the employer of the exposed individual, if any. An employer who directs and controls the exposed individual shall provide the postexposure evaluation and followup required by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health as well as the testing and counseling for source patients required under this chapter. If an exposed individual is a volunteer or a student, then the health care provider or first responder that assigned a task to the volunteer or student may pay for the costs of testing and counseling as if that volunteer or student were an employee. If an exposed individual, who is not an employee of a health facility or of another health care provider, chooses to obtain postexposure evaluation or followup counseling, or both, or treatment, he or she shall be financially responsible for the costs thereof and shall be responsible for the costs of the testing and counseling for the source patient.

(g)  This section does not authorize the disclosure of the source patient’s identity.

(h)  This section does not authorize a health care provider to draw blood or other body fluids except as otherwise authorized by law.

(i)  The provisions of this section are cumulative only and shall not preclude testing of source patients for a communicable disease, as authorized by any other law.

(j)  Except as otherwise provided under this section, all confidentiality requirements regarding medical records that are provided for under existing law apply to this section.

_(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 303, Sec. 348. (AB 731) Effective January 1, 2016.)_

###### 120263.



(a) No health care provider, as defined in this chapter, shall be subject to civil or criminal liability or professional disciplinary action for performing tests for a communicable disease on the available blood or patient sample of a source patient, or for disclosing the communicable disease status of a source patient to the source patient, an attending physician of the source patient, the certifying physician, the exposed individual, or any attending physician of the exposed individual, if the health care provider has acted in good faith in complying with this chapter.

(b) Any health care provider or first responder, or any exposed individual, who willfully performs or permits the performance of a test for a communicable disease on a source patient, that results in economic, bodily, or psychological harm to the source patient, without adhering to the procedure set forth in this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed one year, or a fine not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by both.

###### 120290.



(a) (1) A defendant is guilty of intentional transmission of an infectious or communicable disease if all of the following apply:

(A) The defendant knows that he or she or a third party is afflicted with an infectious or communicable disease.

(B) The defendant acts with the specific intent to transmit or cause an afflicted third party to transmit that disease to another person.

(C) The defendant or the afflicted third party engages in conduct that poses a substantial risk of transmission to that person.

(D) The defendant or the third party transmits the infectious or communicable disease to the other person.

(E) If exposure occurs through interaction with the defendant and not a third party, the person exposed to the disease during voluntary interaction with the defendant did not know that the defendant was afflicted with the disease. A person’s interaction with the defendant is not involuntary solely on the basis of his or her lack of knowledge that the defendant was afflicted with the disease.

(2) A defendant is guilty of willful exposure to an infectious or communicable disease if a health officer, or the health officer’s designee, acting under circumstances that make securing a quarantine or health officer order infeasible, has instructed the defendant not to engage in particularized conduct that poses a substantial risk of transmission of an infectious or communicable disease, and the defendant engages in that conduct within 96 hours of the instruction. A health officer, or the health officer’s designee, may issue a maximum of two instructions to a defendant that may result in a violation of this paragraph.

(b) The defendant does not act with the intent required pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) if the defendant takes, or attempts to take, practical means to prevent transmission.

(c) Failure to take practical means to prevent transmission alone is insufficient to prove the intent required pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a).

(d) Becoming pregnant while infected with an infectious or communicable disease, continuing a pregnancy while infected with an infectious or communicable disease, or declining treatment for an infectious or communicable disease during pregnancy does not constitute a crime for purposes of this section.

(e) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:

(1) “Conduct that poses a substantial risk of transmission” means an activity that has a reasonable probability of disease transmission as proven by competent medical or epidemiological evidence.

The test shall be made available by the county either directly or by contract with a physician and surgeon or with any clinic or health facility licensed by the department. Neither the county nor anyone else administering the test described in this section and Sections 120885 and 120890, shall ask for the name, social security number, or any other information that could reveal the identity of the individual who takes the test. Each alternative test site shall make available confidential information and referral services, within the funds available, to individuals who seek testing. A county may subcontract with individuals or entities to provide information and referral services.

All alternative test sites shall provide a referral list of physicians and surgeons or clinics knowledgeable about AIDS, to all persons who have any known risk factor for AIDS, especially those who have a reactive antibody test, for further information and explanation of the test results and for medical evaluation.

At a minimum, individuals seeking testing shall be informed about the validity and accuracy of the antibody test before the test is performed. All testing site personnel shall be required to attest to having provided the above information. Furthermore, all individuals who are tested at the sites established by this section and Sections 120885 and 120890 shall be given the results of this test in person. All sites providing antibody testing pursuant to this section and Sections 120885 and 120890 shall have a protocol for referral for 24-hour inpatient and mental health services. All individuals awaiting test results and all persons to whom results are reported shall be informed of available crisis services and shall be directly referred, if necessary.

Each county, designated by the director, shall be required to submit a plan to the department within 45 days after the effective date of this section that details where testing and pretest and posttest information and referral will be provided and the qualifications of the staff who will be performing the services required by this section and Sections 120885 and 120890. The department shall make training available, especially to smaller counties.

(b) The department shall establish a reimbursement process for counties within 30 days after the effective date of this section for the following services:

(2) Administration of tests, analysis of test samples, and costs associated with the laboratory work required by this antibody test.

(3) Short-term information and referral sessions, of no more than one visit per person tested for the purpose of transmitting the person’s test results and, as requested, for referral to available followup services.

The department shall establish the amounts to be reimbursed for each of these services, but the amounts shall be established at a level to ensure that the purposes of this section and Sections 120885 and 120890 are carried out. Reimbursements shall be made for each service provided.

(c) The department may replace the test for the antibody to the probable causative agent for AIDS with another type of HIV test, as the department deems appropriate.

(d) The director may grant a waiver to a county from the requirements of this section and Sections 120885 and 120890 if the county petitions the director for the waiver and the director determines that the waiver is consistent with the purposes of this section and Sections 120885 and 120890.

(e) A participating county or the department may accept grants, donations, and in-kind services for purposes of carrying out this section and Sections 120885 and 120890.

###### 120920.



The Legislature hereby finds and declares that people with HIV infection may not avail themselves of early intervention services unless they are aware of the availability of the services and the efficacy of early intervention in prolonging life. This awareness by HIV-infected persons is critical to maximizing the benefits of early intervention. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that the department includes early intervention education as a component of information and education grants in the first grant cycle following enactment of Sections 120900 to 120920, inclusive.

_( Chapter 5 added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 7. )_

\


###### 120925.



The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:

(a)  The drug azidothymidine (AZT) improves and prolongs the quality of life for those suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related conditions, is believed to reduce the infectiousness of a person infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and is the only drug approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AIDS and AIDS-related conditions.

(b)  Hundreds of Californians infected with HIV are receiving AZT due to a subsidy for AZT made available by the federal government for low-income people.

(c)  The department estimates that it will have sufficient federal funds to maintain those enrolling in the program prior to October 1, 1988, through April 1989, if it terminates new enrollees beginning October 1, 1988.

(d)  The department intends to direct counties to cease accepting new enrollees for the subsidy program beginning October 1, 1988, because of the exhaustion of these federal funds.

(e)  The federal government has an obligation to continue to support the subsidy program that it has initiated because of the horrendous moral consequences of terminating the access of low-income infected people to the drug.

(f)  The funding cycle for federal programs precludes appropriating additional funds to maintain this program until June of 1989.

_(Added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 7. Effective January 1, 1996.)_

###### 120930.



It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of California continue to provide temporary funding for the program to ensure that those whose health depends on obtaining access to AZT and who are unable to afford it can receive the drug during this interim period.

_(Added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 7. Effective January 1, 1996.)_

###### 120935.



The department shall continue through June 1989, the AZT subsidy program established in 1987 with federal funds. The department shall maintain the eligibility standards used for the program as of August 1988. The department shall allocate to local health jurisdictions the funds appropriated to support the subsidy program. The department may reallocate funds among these local health jurisdictions as needed to ensure that persons requiring the subsidy receive it through June 1989.

_( Chapter 6 added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 7. )_

\


###### 120950.



The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:

(a)  State-of-art knowledge regarding treatment of people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) indicates that active HIV infection (AIDS) can be a manageable, though chronic, condition with the use of drugs such as zidovudine (AZT), aerosolized pentamidine, and ganciclovir. AIDS experts across the nation agree that early intervention with these drugs can prolong life, minimize the related occurrences of more serious illnesses, reduce more costly treatments, and maximize the HIV-infected person’s vitality and productivity.

(b)  For reasons of compassion and cost effectiveness, the State of California has a compelling interest in ensuring that its citizens infected with the HIV virus have access to these drugs.

(c)  The department subsidizes the cost of these drugs for persons who do not have private health coverage, are not eligible for Medi-Cal, or cannot afford to purchase the drug privately. The subsidy program is funded through state and federal sources.

(d)  Congress is expected to place limitations on the federal subsidy program that will jeopardize access to these life-prolonging drugs for people whose income is higher than federal income eligibility cap but lower than the state’s income eligibility cap.

(e)  It is critical that suffering persons with limited income have access to life-prolonging drugs. It is also critical that persons currently eligible for the subsidy program remain eligible regardless of changes that may result from the congressional action and the enactment of this chapter. However, it is appropriate that people who can afford to pay a portion of the cost of treatment be obligated to share the cost of these drugs.

_(Added by Stats. 1995, Ch. 415, Sec. 7. Effective January 1, 1996.)_

###### 120955.



(a) (1) To the extent that state and federal funds are appropriated in the annual Budget Act for these purposes, the director shall establish and may administer a program to provide drug treatments to persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the etiologic agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). If the director makes a formal determination that, in any fiscal year, funds appropriated for the program will be insufficient to provide all of those drug treatments to existing eligible persons for the fiscal year and that a suspension of the implementation of the program is necessary, the director may suspend eligibility determinations and enrollment in the program for the period of time necessary to meet the needs of existing eligible persons in the program.

(2) The director, in consultation with the AIDS Drug Assistance Program Medical Advisory Committee, shall develop, maintain, and update as necessary a list of drugs to be provided under this program. The list shall be exempt from the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340), Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 11370), and Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), and shall not be subject to the review and approval of the Office of Administrative Law.

(b) The director may grant funds to a county public health department through standard agreements to administer this program in that county. To maximize the recipients’ access to drugs covered by this program, the director shall urge the county health department in counties granted these funds to decentralize distribution of the drugs to the recipients.

(c) The director shall establish a rate structure for reimbursement for the cost of each drug included in the program. Rates shall not be less than the actual cost of the drug. However, the director may purchase a listed drug directly from the manufacturer and negotiate the most favorable bulk price for that drug.

(d) Manufacturers of the drugs on the list shall pay the department a rebate equal to the rebate that would be applicable to the drug under Section 1927(c) of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396r-8(c)) plus an additional rebate to be negotiated by each manufacturer with the department, except that no rebates shall be paid to the department under this section on drugs for which the department has received a rebate under Section 1927(c) of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396r-8(c)) or that have been purchased on behalf of county health departments or other eligible entities at discount prices made available under Section 256b of Title 42 of the United States Code.

(e) The department shall submit an invoice, not less than two times per year, to each manufacturer for the amount of the rebate required by subdivision (d).

(f) Drugs may be removed from the list for failure to pay the rebate required by subdivision (d), unless the department determines that removal of the drug from the list would cause substantial medical hardship to beneficiaries.

(g) The department may adopt emergency regulations to implement amendments to this chapter made during the 1997–98 Regular Session, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code). The initial adoption of emergency regulations shall be deemed to be an emergency and considered by the Office of Administrative Law as necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, or general welfare. Emergency regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall remain in effect for no more than 180 days.

(h) Reimbursement under this chapter shall not be made for any drugs that are available to the recipient under any other private, state, or federal programs, or under any other contractual or legal entitlements, except that the director may authorize an exemption from this subdivision where exemption would represent a cost savings to the state.

(i) The department may also subsidize certain cost-sharing requirements for persons otherwise eligible for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) with existing non-ADAP drug coverage by paying for prescription drugs included on the ADAP formulary within the existing ADAP operational structure up to, but not exceeding, the amount of that cost-sharing obligation. This cost sharing may only be applied in circumstances in which the other payer recognizes the ADAP payment as counting toward the individual’s cost-sharing obligation. The department may subsidize, using available federal funds and moneys from the AIDS Drug Assistance Program Rebate Fund, costs associated with a health care service plan or health insurance policy, including medical copayments and deductibles for outpatient care, and premiums to purchase or maintain health insurance coverage.

_(Amended by Stats. 2017, Ch. 52, Sec. 14. (SB 97) Effective July 10, 2017.)_

###### 120956.



(a) The AIDS Drug Assistance Program Rebate Fund is hereby created as a special fund in the State Treasury.

(g) Nothing in this section permits a person to unlawfully disclose an individual’s HIV status, or to otherwise violate provisions of Section 54 of the Civil Code, the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336), or the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (Part 2.8 (commencing with Section 12900) of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), which prohibit discrimination against individuals who are living with HIV, who test positive for HIV, or who are presumed to be HIV-positive.

(h) After the results of a test performed pursuant to this section have been received, the medical care provider or the person who administers the test shall ensure that the patient receives timely information and counseling, as appropriate, to explain the results and the implications for the patient’s health. If the patient tests positive for HIV infection, the medical provider or the person who administers the test shall inform the patient that there are numerous treatment options available and identify followup testing and care that may be recommended, including contact information for medical and psychological services. If the patient tests negative for HIV infection and is determined to be at high risk for HIV infection by the medical provider or person administering the test, the medical provider or the person who administers the test shall advise the patient of the need for periodic retesting, explain the limitations of current testing technology and the current window period for verification of results, and provide information about methods that prevent or reduce the risk of contracting HIV, including, but not limited to, preexposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis, consistent with guidance of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and may offer prevention counseling or a referral to prevention counseling.

(i) This section shall not apply to a clinical laboratory.
