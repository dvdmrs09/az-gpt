## 2023 Florida Statutes (including 2023C)

701.01âAssignment.âAny mortgagee may assign and transfer any mortgage made to her or him, and the person to whom any mortgage may be assigned or transferred may also assign and transfer it, and that person or her or his assigns or subsequent assignees may lawfully have, take and pursue the same means and remedies which the mortgagee may lawfully have, take or pursue for the foreclosure of a mortgage and for the recovery of the money secured thereby.

History.âs. 1, Dec. 11, 1834; RS 1985; GS 2498; RGS 3840; CGL 5743; s. 782, ch. 97-102.

701.02âAssignment not effectual against creditors unless recorded and indicated in title of document; applicability.â

(1)âAn assignment of a mortgage upon real property or of any interest therein, is not good or effectual in law or equity, against creditors or subsequent purchasers, for a valuable consideration, and without notice, unless the assignment is contained in a document that, in its title, indicates an assignment of mortgage and is recorded according to law.

(2)âThis section also applies to assignments of mortgages resulting from transfers of all or any part or parts of the debt, note or notes secured by mortgage, and none of same is effectual in law or in equity against creditors or subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration without notice, unless a duly executed assignment be recorded according to law.

(3)âAny assignment of a mortgage, duly executed and recorded according to law, purporting to assign the principal of the mortgage debt or the unpaid balance of such principal, shall, as against subsequent purchasers and creditors for value and without notice, be held and deemed to assign any and all accrued and unpaid interest secured by such mortgage, unless such interest is specifically and affirmatively reserved in such an assignment by the assignor, and a reservation of such interest or any part thereof may not be implied.

(4)âNotwithstanding subsections (1), (2), and (3) governing the assignment of mortgages, chapters 670-680 of the Uniform Commercial Code of this state govern the attachment and perfection of a security interest in a mortgage upon real property and in a promissory note or other right to payment or performance secured by that mortgage. The assignment of such a mortgage need not be recorded under this section for purposes of attachment or perfection of a security interest in the mortgage under the Uniform Commercial Code.

(5)âNotwithstanding subsection (4), a creditor or subsequent purchaser of real property or any interest therein, for valuable consideration and without notice, is entitled to rely on a full or partial release, discharge, consent, joinder, subordination, satisfaction, or assignment of a mortgage upon such property made by the mortgagee of record, without regard to the filing of any Uniform Commercial Code financing statement that purports to perfect a security interest in the mortgage or in a promissory note or other right to payment or performance secured by the mortgage, and the filing of any such financing statement does not constitute notice for the purposes of this section. For the purposes of this subsection, the term âmortgagee of recordâ means the person named as the mortgagee in the recorded mortgage or, if an assignment of the mortgage has been recorded in accordance with this section, the term âmortgagee of recordâ means the assignee named in the recorded assignment.

(1)âWhenever the amount of money due under a promissory note secured by a mortgage is fully paid, the mortgagee or assignee shall within 45 days after satisfaction of the mortgage thereafter cancel the mortgage in the manner provided by law, unless the mortgage is an open-end mortgage.

(2)âA mortgage that is an open-end mortgage as provided in the loan agreement may be canceled upon written notice from the borrower of the intent to close the mortgage. The mortgagee or assignee shall cancel the open-end mortgage within 45 days after receiving the notice. This subsection does not apply to an open-end mortgage existing before July 1, 2016, if the loan agreement contained procedures for canceling the mortgage.

[1](#1)701.04âCancellation of mortgages, liens, and judgments.â

(1)(a)âWithin 10 days after receipt of the written request of a mortgagor, a record title owner of the property, a fiduciary or trustee lawfully acting on behalf of a record title owner, or any other person lawfully authorized to act on behalf of a mortgagor or record title owner of the property, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer shall send or cause to be sent an estoppel letter setting forth the unpaid balance of the loan secured by the mortgage. If the written request is made by a person other than the mortgagor, the request must include a copy of the instrument showing such personâs title in the property or other lawful authorization, and the mortgagee or mortgage servicer must notify the mortgagor of the request.

(b)âThe estoppel letter must at a minimum include:

1.âThe unpaid balance of the loan secured by the mortgage as of the date specified in the estoppel letter, including an itemization of the principal, interest, and any other charges comprising the unpaid balance; and

2.âInterest accruing on a per-day basis for the unpaid balance from and after the date specified in the estoppel letter, if applicable.

(c)1.âExcept for mortgages for which a notice of lis pendens in a foreclosure action or a suggestion of bankruptcy has been properly filed and recorded, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer may not qualify, reserve the right to change, or condition or disclaim the reliance of others on the information provided in an estoppel letter under paragraph (b), and any attempt to do so is void and unenforceable. However, if the mortgagee or mortgage servicer determines that any of the information provided in the estoppel letter under paragraph (b) was inaccurate, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer may send a corrected estoppel letter to the person who requested the estoppel letter in the same manner as used to respond to the original written request. If the original written request is made by a person other than the mortgagor, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer must also provide a copy of any corrected estoppel letter to the mortgagor.

2.âIf the person who requested the original estoppel letter under paragraph (a) receives a corrected estoppel letter by 3 p.m. in such personâs time zone at least 1 business day before a payment is issued in reliance on the previous estoppel letter, the corrected estoppel letter supersedes all prior estoppel letters.

3.âIf any of the information provided in the estoppel letter under paragraph (b) was inaccurate, but the person who requested the estoppel letter did not timely receive a corrected estoppel letter as provided in subparagraph 2., the mortgagee or mortgage servicer may not deny the accuracy of such information as against any person who relied on it. This subparagraph does not affect the right of a mortgagee to recover any sum that it did not include in an estoppel letter from any person liable for payment of the loan or other obligations secured by the mortgage, nor does it limit any claim or defense to recovery which such person may have at law or in equity.

(d)âThe mortgagee or mortgage servicer acting in accordance with a request in substantial compliance with this subsection is expressly discharged from any obligation or liability to any person on account of the release of the requested information, other than the obligation to comply with the terms of the estoppel letter.

(e)âIf a payment is received at the location and in the manner specified by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer must accept and may not return any payment received in reliance on an estoppel letter and must promptly apply such payment to the unpaid balance of the loan properly due under or secured by the mortgage.

(f)1.âA written request for an estoppel letter under paragraph (a) must be sent to the mortgagee or mortgage servicer by first-class mail, postage prepaid; by common carrier delivery service; or by e-mail, facsimile, or other electronic means at the address made available by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer for such purpose or through an automated system provided by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer for requesting an estoppel letter. The written request is considered received by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer:

a.âFive business days after the request sent by first-class mail is deposited with the United States Postal Service;

b.âThe day the request is delivered by a common carrier delivery service; or

c.âThe day the request is sent by e-mail, facsimile, or other electronic means or through an automated system provided by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer for requesting an estoppel letter.

If any of the days in sub-subparagraph a., sub-subparagraph b., or sub-subparagraph c. fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday specified in s. [110.117](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/110.117)(1) or the laws of the United States, the request for an estoppel letter is considered timely received by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer on the next business day.

2.âThe mortgagee or mortgage servicer must send an estoppel letter by first-class mail, postage prepaid; by common carrier delivery service; or by e-mail, facsimile, or other electronic means, as directed in the written request, or through an automated system provided by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer for this purpose. However, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer is not required to pay for a common carrier delivery service. If the 10-day period after a written request is received by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday specified in s. [110.117](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/110.117)(1) or the laws of the United States, the estoppel letter is considered timely if it is sent by the close of business on the next business day.

(g)âNotwithstanding s. [655.059](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/655.059), a mortgagee or mortgage servicer may provide the financial information required under this subsection to a person authorized under this subsection to request the financial information.

(2)(a)âWithin 60 days after the unpaid balance of a loan secured by a mortgage has been fully paid or paid pursuant to an estoppel letter under subsection (1), whichever is earlier, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer shall execute in writing an instrument acknowledging release of the mortgage; have the instrument acknowledged, or proven, and send it or cause it to be sent for recording in the official records of the proper county; and send or cause to be sent the recorded release to the mortgagor or record title owner of the property. The prevailing party in a civil action brought against the mortgagee or mortgage servicer to enforce the requirements of this paragraph is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs.

(b)âThe recorded release of the mortgage does not relieve the mortgagor, or the mortgagorâs successors or assigns, from any personal liability on the loan or other obligations previously secured by the mortgage.

(3)âWithin 60 days after the unpaid balance on a lien or judgment has been fully paid to the person entitled to the payment thereof, the creditor or assignee, or the attorney of record in the case of a judgment, to whom the payment was made shall execute in writing an instrument acknowledging satisfaction of the lien or judgment; have the instrument acknowledged, or proven, and send it or cause it to be sent for recording in the official records of the proper county; and send or cause to be sent the recorded satisfaction to the person who has made the full payment. The prevailing party in a civil action brought against the creditor or assignee, or the attorney of record in the case of a judgment, to enforce the requirements of this subsection is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs.

(4)âWhen a writ of execution has been issued, docketed, and indexed with a sheriff and the judgment upon which it was issued has been fully paid, it is the responsibility of the person receiving payment to request, in writing, addressed to the sheriff, return of the writ of execution as fully satisfied.

Source: [https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0701.041](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0701.041)

(1)âDEFINITIONS.âFor purposes of this section:

[1](#1)(a)ââEstoppel letterâ means a statement containing, at a minimum, the information required in s. [701.04](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/701.04)(1)(b).

(b)ââMortgageeâ means:

1.âThe grantee of a mortgage; or

2.âIf a mortgage has been assigned of record, the last person to whom the mortgage has been assigned of record.

(c)ââMortgage servicerâ means the last person to whom a mortgagor or the mortgagorâs successor in interest has been instructed by a mortgagee to send payments on a loan secured by a mortgage. A person transmitting an estoppel letter is the mortgage servicer for the mortgage described in the estoppel letter.

(d)ââMortgagorâ means the grantor of a mortgage.

(e)ââRecordâ means to record with the clerk of the circuit court or the comptroller in the county or counties in which the real property securing the mortgage is located.

(f)ââTitle insurerâ means a corporation or other business entity authorized and licensed to transact the business of insuring titles to interests in real property in this state under chapter 624.

[1](#1)(2)âCERTIFICATE OF RELEASE.âAn officer or duly appointed agent of a title insurer may, on behalf of a mortgagor or a person who acquired from the mortgagor title to all or a part of the property described in a mortgage, execute a certificate of release that complies with the requirements of this section and record the certificate of release in the real property records of each county in which the mortgage is recorded if a satisfaction or release of the mortgage has not been executed and recorded after the date payment in full of the loan properly due under or secured by the mortgage was made in accordance with an estoppel letter furnished by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer.

(3)âCONTENTS.âA certificate of release executed under this section must contain:

(a)âThe name of the mortgagor, the name of the original mortgagee, and, if applicable, the mortgage servicer; the date of the mortgage; the date of recording; and the volume and page or document number in the real property records in which the mortgage is recorded, together with similar information for the last recorded assignment of the mortgage.

(b)âA statement that the mortgage being released is eligible for release under this section.

(c)âThe name of the title insurer filing the certificate of release, a statement that the person executing the certificate of release is an officer or a duly appointed agent of the title insurer, a statement that the title insurer is authorized and licensed to transact the business of insuring titles to interests in real property in this state under chapter 624 or chapter 626, and, if executed by a duly appointed agent, shall further provide the recording information of the appointment of such agent as required by subsection (4).

(d)âA statement that the certificate of release is made on behalf of the mortgagor or a person who acquired title from the mortgagor to all or a part of the property described in the mortgage.

(e)âA statement that the mortgagee or mortgage servicer provided an estoppel letter which was used to make payment in full of the unpaid balance of the loan secured by the mortgage.

(f)âA statement that payment in full of the unpaid balance of the loan secured by the mortgage was made in accordance with the estoppel letter and that a copy of the certificate of release was sent to the mortgagee or mortgage servicer that provided the estoppel letter.

(4)âEXECUTION.â

(a)âA certificate of release authorized by subsection (2) must be duly executed, sworn to or affirmed under penalty of perjury before a notary public, and recorded and may be executed by an officer of a title insurer or by a duly appointed agent of a title insurer. Such delegation to an agent by a title insurer shall not relieve the title insurer of any liability for damages caused by the agent for the execution or recordation of a certificate of release.

(b)âThe appointment of an agent must be duly executed, acknowledged, and recorded by an officer of a title insurer and must state:

1.âThe title insurer as the principal.

2.âThe identity of the person, partnership, or corporation authorized to act as agent to execute and record certificates of release provided for in this section on behalf of the title insurer.

3.âThat the agent has the full authority to execute and record certificates of release provided for in this section on behalf of the title insurer.

(c)âA separate appointment of agent shall not be necessary for each certificate of release provided that at least one such appointment is recorded in the county in which the mortgaged property is located. The appointment of agent must be rerecorded where necessary to establish authority of the agent, but such authority shall continue until a revocation of appointment is recorded in the office of the county recorder in which the appointment of agent was recorded.

(d)âAfter recordation of a title insurerâs revocation of appointment in the office of the county recorder in which the appointment was recorded, the agent whose appointment is revoked in such county shall have no further authority to execute or record certificates of release as provided in this section on behalf of that title insurer with respect to any mortgages recorded in that county, and no such certificate of release thereafter executed or recorded by that agent on behalf of that title insurer shall be effective to release any mortgage recorded in that county.

(5)âEFFECT.âFor purposes of releasing the mortgage, a certificate of release containing the information and statements provided for in subsection (3) and executed as provided in subsection (4) is entitled to be recorded with the county recorder and operates as a release of the mortgage described in the certificate of release. The county recorder shall rely upon the certificate to release the mortgage. Recording of a certificate of release by a title insurer or its agent shall not relieve the mortgagor, or the mortgagorâs successors or assigns, from any personal liability on the loan or other obligations secured by the mortgage. A certificate of release recorded pursuant to this section fulfills any other obligation of the mortgagee or mortgage servicer to file a satisfaction or release of the mortgage.

(6)âLIABILITY OF TITLE INSURER AND TITLE INSURANCE AGENT.â

(a)âIn addition to any other remedy provided by law, a title insurer and title insurance agent recording a certificate of release under this section shall be liable to the holder of the obligation secured by the mortgage for actual damage sustained due to the recording of the certificate of release. Reasonable costs and attorneysâ fees shall be awarded to the prevailing party.

(b)âThe title insurer named in a certificate of release filed by a duly appointed agent shall be liable pursuant to this subsection without regard to whether the title insurer authorized the specific certificate of release recorded by the agent.

(c)âThe title insurer and title insurance agent shall have no liability under this subsection if the title insurer or title insurance agent shows that payment in full of the unpaid balance of the loan secured by the mortgage was made in accordance with the estoppel letter furnished by the mortgagee or the mortgage servicer.

(d)âLiability of a title insurer pursuant to this section shall be considered to be a title insurance claim on real property in this state pursuant to s. [627.7865](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/627.7865).

(7)âRECORDING.âIf a mortgage is recorded in more than one county and a certificate of release is recorded in one of such counties, a certified copy of the certificate of release may be recorded in another of such counties with the same effect as the original. In all cases, the certificate of release shall be entered and indexed as satisfactions of mortgage are entered and indexed.

(8)âAPPLICATION.âThis section applies only to a mortgage that secures a loan in the principal amount of $500,000 or less as determined from the recorded mortgage and contains no disclosure of record that the mortgage secures an open-end or revolving line of credit agreement.

702.015âElements of complaint; lost, destroyed, or stolen note affidavit.â

(1)âThe Legislature intends that this section expedite the foreclosure process by ensuring initial disclosure of a plaintiffâs status and the facts supporting that status, thereby ensuring the availability of documents necessary to the prosecution of the case.

(2)âA complaint that seeks to foreclose a mortgage or other lien on residential real property, including individual units of condominiums and cooperatives, designed principally for occupation by from one to four families which secures a promissory note must:

(a)âContain affirmative allegations expressly made by the plaintiff at the time the proceeding is commenced that the plaintiff is the holder of the original note secured by the mortgage; or

(b)âAllege with specificity the factual basis by which the plaintiff is a person entitled to enforce the note under s. 673.3011.

(3)âIf a plaintiff has been delegated the authority to institute a mortgage foreclosure action on behalf of the person entitled to enforce the note, the complaint shall describe the authority of the plaintiff and identify, with specificity, the document that grants the plaintiff the authority to act on behalf of the person entitled to enforce the note. This subsection is intended to require initial disclosure of status and pertinent facts and not to modify law regarding standing or real parties in interest. The term âoriginal noteâ or âoriginal promissory noteâ means the signed or executed promissory note rather than a copy thereof. The term includes any renewal, replacement, consolidation, or amended and restated note or instrument given in renewal, replacement, or substitution for a previous promissory note. The term also includes a transferable record, as defined by the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act in s. 668.50(16).

(4)âIf the plaintiff is in possession of the original promissory note, the plaintiff must file under penalty of perjury a certification with the court, contemporaneously with the filing of the complaint for foreclosure, that the plaintiff is in possession of the original promissory note. The certification must set forth the location of the note, the name and title of the individual giving the certification, the name of the person who personally verified such possession, and the time and date on which the possession was verified. Correct copies of the note and all allonges to the note must be attached to the certification. The original note and the allonges must be filed with the court before the entry of any judgment of foreclosure or judgment on the note.

(5)âIf the plaintiff seeks to enforce a lost, destroyed, or stolen instrument, an affidavit executed under penalty of perjury must be attached to the complaint. The affidavit must:

(a)âDetail a clear chain of all endorsements, transfers, or assignments of the promissory note that is the subject of the action.

(b)âSet forth facts showing that the plaintiff is entitled to enforce a lost, destroyed, or stolen instrument pursuant to s. 673.3091. Adequate protection as required under s. 673.3091(2) shall be provided before the entry of final judgment.

(c)âInclude as exhibits to the affidavit such copies of the note and the allonges to the note, audit reports showing receipt of the original note, or other evidence of the acquisition, ownership, and possession of the note as may be available to the plaintiff.

(6)âThe court may sanction the plaintiff for failure to comply with this section.

(7)âThis section does not apply to any foreclosure proceeding involving timeshare interests under part III of chapter 721.

History.âs. 3, ch. 2013-137.

702.03âCertain foreclosures validated.âAll mortgage foreclosures heretofore made, or now pending, wherein there has been annexed to the bill of complaint in such cause, an uncertified copy of the mortgage, as provided by chapter 12095, Acts of 1927, entitled: âAn act to amend section 3845 RGS relating to complaint in foreclosure of mortgagesâ are hereby validated and confirmed insofar as they relate to the copy of the mortgage attached to such complaint, to the same extent and effect as if section 3117, RGS, had been expressly repealed by chapter 12095, 1927, entitled: âAn act to amend section 3845 RGS relating to complaint in foreclosure of mortgages.â

History.âs. 1, ch. 13642, 1929; CGL 1936 Supp. 5748(1).

702.035âLegal notice concerning foreclosure proceedings.âWhenever a legal advertisement, publication, or notice relating to a foreclosure proceeding is required to be placed in a newspaper, it is the responsibility of the petitioner or petitionerâs attorney to place such advertisement, publication, or notice. For counties with more than 1 million total population as reflected in the 2000 Official Decennial Census of the United States Census Bureau as shown on the official website of the United States Census Bureau, any notice of publication required by this section shall be deemed to have been published in accordance with the law if the notice is published in a newspaper that has been entered as a periodical matter at a post office in the county in which the newspaper is published, is published a minimum of 5 days a week, exclusive of legal holidays, and has been in existence and published a minimum of 5 days a week, exclusive of legal holidays, for 1 year or is a direct successor to a newspaper that has been in existence for 1 year that has been published a minimum of 5 days a week, exclusive of legal holidays. The advertisement, publication, or notice shall be placed directly by the attorney for the petitioner, by the petitioner if acting pro se, or by the clerk of the court. Only the actual costs charged by the newspaper for the advertisement, publication, or notice may be charged as costs in the action.

History.âs. 4, ch. 2001-215; s. 7, ch. 2006-175; s. 2, ch. 2007-185.

702.036âFinality of foreclosure judgment.â

(1)âAs used in this section, the term âpropertyâ means real property.

(2)(a)âIn any action or proceeding in which a party seeks to set aside, invalidate, or challenge the validity of a final judgment of foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien, or to establish or reestablish a lien or encumbrance on the property in abrogation of the final judgment of foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien, the court shall treat such request solely as a claim for monetary damages and may not grant relief that adversely affects the quality or character of the title to the property, if:

1.âThe party seeking relief from the final judgment of foreclosure of the mortgage or lien was properly served in the foreclosure lawsuit as provided in chapter 48 or chapter 49.

2.âThe final judgment of foreclosure of the mortgage or lien was entered as to the property.

3.âAll applicable appeals periods have run as to the final judgment of foreclosure of the mortgage or lien with no appeals having been taken or any appeals having been finally resolved.

4.âThe property has been acquired for value, by a person not affiliated with the foreclosing mortgageholder, the foreclosing lienholder, or the foreclosed owner, at a time in which no lis pendens regarding the suit to set aside, invalidate, or challenge the foreclosure appears in the official records of the county where the property was located.

(b)âThis subsection does not limit the right to pursue any other relief to which a person may be entitled, including, but not limited to, compensatory damages, punitive damages, statutory damages, consequential damages, injunctive relief, or fees and costs, which does not adversely affect the ownership of the title to the property as vested in the unaffiliated purchaser for value.

(3)âFor purposes of this section, the following, without limitation, shall be considered persons affiliated with the foreclosing mortgageholder or foreclosing lienholder:

(a)âThe foreclosing mortgageholder, the foreclosing lienholder, or any loan servicer for the mortgage or lien being foreclosed;

(b)âAny past or present owner or holder of the mortgage or lien being foreclosed;

(c)âAny maintenance company, holding company, foreclosure services company, or law firm under contract to any entity listed in paragraph (a), paragraph (b), or this paragraph, with regard to the mortgage or lien being foreclosed; or

(d)âAny parent entity, subsidiary, or other person who directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, any entity listed in paragraph (a), paragraph (b), or paragraph (c).

(4)âAfter foreclosure of a mortgage based upon the enforcement of a lost, destroyed, or stolen note, a person who is not a party to the underlying foreclosure action but who claims to be the person entitled to enforce the promissory note secured by the foreclosed mortgage has no claim against the foreclosed property after it is conveyed for valuable consideration to a person not affiliated with the foreclosing lender or the foreclosed owner. This section does not preclude the person entitled to enforce the promissory note from pursuing recovery from any adequate protection given pursuant to s. 673.3091 or from the party who wrongfully claimed to be the person entitled to enforce the promissory note under s. 702.11(2) or otherwise, from the maker of the note, or from any other person against whom it may have a claim relating to the note.

(5)âIf a party seeks relief from a final judgment foreclosing a mortgage or lien, or files a separate action attacking such a final judgment, and the party claims that it holds or held a lien superior in right, priority, or dignity to the mortgage or lien foreclosed in the judgment, the court must award reasonable attorney fees to the party prevailing on the claim. This subsection applies whether the litigation seeking relief from the final judgment occurs in the case in which the judgment was entered or in any separate case or proceeding.

History.âs. 4, ch. 2013-137; s. 3, ch. 2023-215.

702.04âMortgaged lands in different counties.âWhen a mortgage includes lands, railroad track, right-of-way, or terminal facilities and station grounds, lying in two or more counties, it may be foreclosed in any one of said counties, and all proceedings shall be had in that county as if all the mortgaged land, railroad track, right-of-way, or terminal facilities and station grounds lay therein, except that notice of the sale must be published in every county wherein any of the lands, railroad track, right-of-way, or terminal facilities and station grounds to be sold lie. After final disposition of the suit, the clerk of the circuit court shall prepare and forward a certified copy of the decree of foreclosure and sale and of the decree of confirmation of sale to the clerk of the circuit court of every county wherein any of the mortgaged lands, railroad tracks, right-of-way, or terminal facilities and station grounds lie, to be recorded in the foreign judgment book of each such county, and the costs of such copies and of the record thereof shall be taxed as costs in the cause.

702.05âMortgaged lands sold for taxes.âAny person who has a lien by mortgage or otherwise upon lands sold for taxes may, within the time allowed by law for redemption, redeem such lands, and the receipt of the officer authorized to receive the amount paid for redemption money shall entitle the lienholder to collect the said amount, with interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum, as a part of and in the same manner as the amount secured by her or his original lien.

702.06âDeficiency decree; common-law suit to recover deficiency.âIn all suits for the foreclosure of mortgages heretofore or hereafter executed the entry of a deficiency decree for any portion of a deficiency, should one exist, shall be within the sound discretion of the court; however, in the case of an owner-occupied residential property, the amount of the deficiency may not exceed the difference between the judgment amount, or in the case of a short sale, the outstanding debt, and the fair market value of the property on the date of sale. For purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a residential property for which a homestead exemption for taxation was granted according to the certified rolls of the latest assessment by the county property appraiser, before the filing of the foreclosure action, is an owner-occupied residential property. The complainant shall also have the right to sue at common law to recover such deficiency, unless the court in the foreclosure action has granted or denied a claim for a deficiency judgment.

702.065âFinal judgment in uncontested proceedings where deficiency judgment waived; attorneyâs fees when default judgment entered.â

(1)âIn uncontested mortgage foreclosure proceedings in which the mortgagee waives the right to recoup any deficiency judgment, the court shall enter final judgment within 90 days from the date of the close of pleadings. For the purposes of this subsection, a mortgage foreclosure proceeding is uncontested if an answer not contesting the foreclosure has been filed or a default judgment has been entered by the court.

(2)âIn a mortgage foreclosure proceeding, when a default judgment has been entered against the mortgagor and the note or mortgage provides for the award of reasonable attorneyâs fees, it is not necessary for the court to hold a hearing or adjudge the requested attorneyâs fees to be reasonable if the fees do not exceed 3 percent of the principal amount owed at the time of filing the complaint, even if the note or mortgage does not specify the percentage of the original amount that would be paid as liquidated damages. Such fees constitute liquidated damages in any proceeding to enforce the note or mortgage. This section does not preclude a challenge to the reasonableness of the attorneyâs fees.

History.âs. 2, ch. 2001-215.

702.07âPower of courts and judges to set aside foreclosure decrees at any time before sale.âThe circuit courts of this state, and the judges thereof at chambers, shall have jurisdiction, power, and authority to rescind, vacate, and set aside a decree of foreclosure of a mortgage of property at any time before the sale thereof has been actually made pursuant to the terms of such decree, and to dismiss the foreclosure proceeding upon the payment of all court costs.

History.âs. 1, ch. 11881, 1927; CGL 5752.

702.08âEffect of setting aside foreclosure decree.âWhenever a decree of foreclosure has been so rescinded, vacated, and set aside and the foreclosure proceedings dismissed as provided in s. 702.07, the mortgage, together with its lien and the debt thereby secured, shall be, both in law and equity, completely relieved of all effects of any kind whatsoever resulting from or on account of the foreclosure proceedings and the decree of foreclosure and fully restored in all respects to the original status of the same as it existed prior to the foreclosure proceedings and the decree of foreclosure, and thereafter the same shall be for all purposes whatsoever legally of force and effect just as if foreclosure proceeding had never been instituted and a decree of foreclosure had never been made.

History.âs. 2, ch. 11881, 1927; CGL 5753.

702.09âDefinitions.âFor the purposes of ss. 702.07 and 702.08, the words âdecree of foreclosureâ shall include a judgment or order rendered or passed in the foreclosure proceedings in which the decree of foreclosure shall be rescinded, vacated, and set aside; the word âmortgageâ shall mean any written instrument securing the payment of money or advances and includes liens to secure payment of assessments arising under chapters 718 and 719 and liens created pursuant to the recorded covenants of a property ownersâ association as defined in s. 712.01; the word âdebtâ shall include promissory notes, bonds, and all other written obligations given for the payment of money; the words âforeclosure proceedingsâ shall embrace every action in the circuit or county courts of this state wherein it is sought to foreclose a mortgage and sell the property covered by the same; and the word âpropertyâ shall mean and include both real and personal property.

702.10âOrder to show cause; entry of final judgment of foreclosure; payment during foreclosure.â

(1)âA lienholder may request an order to show cause for the entry of final judgment in a foreclosure action. For purposes of this section, the term âlienholderâ includes the plaintiff and a defendant to the action who holds a lien encumbering the property or a defendant who, by virtue of its status as a condominium association, cooperative association, or property ownersâ association, may file a lien against the real property subject to foreclosure. Upon filing, the court shall immediately review the request and the court file in chambers and without a hearing. If, upon examination of the court file, the court finds that the complaint is verified, complies with s. 702.015, and alleges a cause of action to foreclose on real property, the court shall promptly issue an order directed to the other parties named in the action to show cause why a final judgment of foreclosure should not be entered.

(a)âThe order shall:

1.âSet the date and time for a hearing to show cause. The date for the hearing may not occur sooner than the later of 20 days after service of the order to show cause or 45 days after service of the initial complaint. When service is obtained by publication, the date for the hearing may not be set sooner than 30 days after the first publication.

2.âDirect the time within which service of the order to show cause and the complaint must be made upon the defendant.

3.âState that the filing of defenses by a motion, a responsive pleading, an affidavit, or other papers before the hearing to show cause that raise a genuine issue of material fact which would preclude the entry of summary judgment or otherwise constitute a legal defense to foreclosure shall constitute cause for the court not to enter final judgment.

4.âState that a defendant has the right to file affidavits or other papers before the time of the hearing to show cause and may appear personally or by way of an attorney at the hearing.

5.âState that, if a defendant files defenses by a motion, a verified or sworn answer, affidavits, or other papers or appears personally or by way of an attorney at the time of the hearing, the hearing time will be used to hear and consider whether the defendantâs motion, answer, affidavits, other papers, and other evidence and argument as may be presented by the defendant or the defendantâs attorney raise a genuine issue of material fact which would preclude the entry of summary judgment or otherwise constitute a legal defense to foreclosure. The order shall also state that the court may enter an order of final judgment of foreclosure at the hearing and order the clerk of the court to conduct a foreclosure sale.

6.âState that, if a defendant fails to appear at the hearing to show cause or fails to file defenses by a motion or by a verified or sworn answer or files an answer not contesting the foreclosure, such defendant may be considered to have waived the right to a hearing, and in such case, the court may enter a default against such defendant and, if appropriate, a final judgment of foreclosure ordering the clerk of the court to conduct a foreclosure sale.

7.âState that if the mortgage provides for reasonable attorney fees and the requested attorney fees do not exceed 3 percent of the principal amount owed at the time of filing the complaint, it is unnecessary for the court to hold a hearing or adjudge the requested attorney fees to be reasonable.

8.âAttach the form of the proposed final judgment of foreclosure which the movant requests the court to enter at the hearing on the order to show cause.

9.âRequire the party seeking final judgment to serve a copy of the order to show cause on the other parties in the following manner:

a.âIf a party has been served pursuant to chapter 48 with the complaint and original process, or the other party is the plaintiff in the action, service of the order to show cause on that party may be made in the manner provided in the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.

b.âIf a defendant has not been served pursuant to chapter 48 with the complaint and original process, the order to show cause, together with the summons and a copy of the complaint, shall be served on the party in the same manner as provided by law for original process.

Any final judgment of foreclosure entered under this subsection is for in rem relief only. This subsection does not preclude the entry of a deficiency judgment where otherwise allowed by law. The Legislature intends that this alternative procedure may run simultaneously with other court procedures.

(b)âThe right to be heard at the hearing to show cause is waived if a defendant, after being served as provided by law with an order to show cause, engages in conduct that clearly shows that the defendant has relinquished the right to be heard on that order. The defendantâs failure to file defenses by a motion or by a sworn or verified answer, affidavits, or other papers or to appear personally or by way of an attorney at the hearing duly scheduled on the order to show cause presumptively constitutes conduct that clearly shows that the defendant has relinquished the right to be heard. If a defendant files defenses by a motion, a verified answer, affidavits, or other papers or presents evidence at or before the hearing which raise a genuine issue of material fact which would preclude entry of summary judgment or otherwise constitute a legal defense to foreclosure, such action constitutes cause and precludes the entry of a final judgment at the hearing to show cause.

(c)âIn a mortgage foreclosure proceeding, when a final judgment of foreclosure has been entered against the mortgagor and the note or mortgage provides for the award of reasonable attorney fees, it is unnecessary for the court to hold a hearing or adjudge the requested attorney fees to be reasonable if the fees do not exceed 3 percent of the principal amount owed on the note or mortgage at the time of filing, even if the note or mortgage does not specify the percentage of the original amount that would be paid as liquidated damages.

(d)âIf the court finds that all defendants have waived the right to be heard as provided in paragraph (b), the court shall promptly enter a final judgment of foreclosure without the need for further hearing if the plaintiff has shown entitlement to a final judgment and upon the filing with the court of the original note, satisfaction of the conditions for establishment of a lost note, or upon a showing to the court that the obligation to be foreclosed is not evidenced by a promissory note or other negotiable instrument. If the court finds that a defendant has not waived the right to be heard on the order to show cause, the court shall determine whether there is cause not to enter a final judgment of foreclosure. If the court finds that the defendant has not shown cause, the court shall promptly enter a judgment of foreclosure. If the time allotted for the hearing is insufficient, the court may announce at the hearing a date and time for the continued hearing. Only the parties who appear, individually or through an attorney, at the initial hearing must be notified of the date and time of the continued hearing.

(2)âExcept as provided in paragraph (i), in any action for foreclosure, in addition to any other relief that the court may award, the plaintiff may request that the court enter an order directing the mortgagor defendant to show cause why an order to make payments during the pendency of the foreclosure proceedings or an order to vacate the premises should not be entered.

(a)âThe order shall:

1.âSet the date and time for hearing on the order to show cause. However, the date for the hearing may not be set sooner than 20 days after the service of the order. If service is obtained by publication, the date for the hearing may not be set sooner than 30 days after the first publication.

2.âDirect the time within which service of the order to show cause and the complaint shall be made upon each defendant.

3.âState that a defendant has the right to file affidavits or other papers at the time of the hearing and may appear personally or by way of an attorney at the hearing.

4.âState that, if a defendant fails to appear at the hearing to show cause and fails to file defenses by a motion or by a verified or sworn answer, the defendant is deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and in such case the court may enter an order to make payment or vacate the premises.

5.âRequire the movant to serve a copy of the order to show cause on the defendant in the following manner:

a.âIf a defendant has been served with the complaint and original process, service of the order may be made in the manner provided in the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.

b.âIf a defendant has not been served with the complaint and original process, the order to show cause, together with the summons and a copy of the complaint, shall be served on the defendant in the same manner as provided by law for original process.

(b)âThe right of a defendant to be heard at the hearing to show cause is waived if the defendant, after being served as provided by law with an order to show cause, engages in conduct that clearly shows that the defendant has relinquished the right to be heard on that order. A defendantâs failure to file defenses by a motion or by a sworn or verified answer or to appear at the hearing duly scheduled on the order to show cause presumptively constitutes conduct that clearly shows that the defendant has relinquished the right to be heard.

(c)âIf the court finds that a defendant has waived the right to be heard as provided in paragraph (b), the court may promptly enter an order requiring payment in the amount provided in paragraph (f) or an order to vacate.

(d)âIf the court finds that the mortgagor has not waived the right to be heard on the order to show cause, the court shall, at the hearing on the order to show cause, consider the affidavits and other showings made by the parties appearing and make a determination of the probable validity of the underlying claim alleged against the mortgagor and the mortgagorâs defenses. If the court determines that the plaintiff is likely to prevail in the foreclosure action, the court shall enter an order requiring the mortgagor to make the payment described in paragraph (e) to the plaintiff and provide for a remedy as described in paragraph (f). However, the order shall be stayed pending final adjudication of the claims of the parties if the mortgagor files with the court a written undertaking executed by a surety approved by the court in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the lien being foreclosed, including all principal, interest, unpaid taxes, and insurance premiums paid by the plaintiff.

(e)âIf the court enters an order requiring the mortgagor to make payments to the plaintiff, payments shall be payable at such intervals and in such amounts provided for in the mortgage instrument before acceleration or maturity. The obligation to make payments pursuant to any order entered under this subsection shall commence from the date of the motion filed under this section. The order shall be served upon the mortgagor no later than 20 days before the date specified for the first payment. The order may permit, but may not require, the plaintiff to take all appropriate steps to secure the premises during the pendency of the foreclosure action.

(f)âIf the court enters an order requiring payments, the order shall also provide that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the premises upon the failure of the mortgagor to make the payment required in the order unless at the hearing on the order to show cause the court finds good cause to order some other method of enforcement of its order.

(g)âAll amounts paid pursuant to this section shall be credited against the mortgage obligation in accordance with the terms of the loan documents; however, payments made under this section do not constitute a cure of any default or a waiver or any other defense to the mortgage foreclosure action.

(h)âUpon the filing of an affidavit with the clerk that the premises have not been vacated pursuant to the court order, the clerk shall issue to the sheriff a writ for possession which shall be governed by s. 83.62.

(i)âThis subsection does not apply to foreclosure of an owner-occupied residence. For purposes of this paragraph, there is a rebuttable presumption that a residential property for which a homestead exemption for taxation was granted according to the certified rolls of the latest assessment by the county property appraiser, before the filing of the foreclosure action, is an owner-occupied residential property.

(j)âFor purposes of this subsection, the term âmortgagorâ means a person who grants a mortgage or a successor in ownership of the real property described in the mortgage. The term does not include a homeownersâ association or an association, as those terms are defined in s. 720.301, or a corporation regulated under chapter 718 or chapter 719, that:

1.âAcquires title to a parcel or unit through the foreclosure of its claim of lien, or a deed in lieu of foreclosure, provided that title remains vested in the association or corporation and any rents collected are applied to assessments that are then due; or

2.âCollects rents from the tenants in the parcel or unit pursuant to s. 718.116(11), s. 719.108(10), or s. 720.3085(8).

702.11âAdequate protections for lost, destroyed, or stolen notes in mortgage foreclosure.â

(1)âIn connection with a mortgage foreclosure, the following constitute reasonable means of providing adequate protection under s. 673.3091, if so found by the court:

(a)âA written indemnification agreement by a person reasonably believed sufficiently solvent to honor such an obligation;

(b)âA surety bond;

(c)âA letter of credit issued by a financial institution;

(d)âA deposit of cash collateral with the clerk of the court; or

(e)âSuch other security as the court may deem appropriate under the circumstances.

Any security given shall be on terms and in amounts set by the court, for a time period through the running of the statute of limitations for enforcement of the underlying note, and conditioned to indemnify and hold harmless the maker of the note against any loss or damage, including principal, interest, and attorney fees and costs, that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the note.

(2)âAny person who wrongly claims to be the holder of or pursuant to s. 673.3011 to be entitled to enforce a lost, stolen, or destroyed note and causes the mortgage secured thereby to be foreclosed is liable to the actual holder of the note, without limitation to any adequate protections given, for actual damages suffered together with attorney fees and costs of the actual holder of the note in enforcing rights under this subsection. In addition, the actual holder of the note may pursue recovery directly against any adequate protections given.

(a)âThe actual holder of the note is not required to pursue recovery against the maker of the note or any guarantor thereof as a condition precedent to pursuing remedies under this section.

(b)âThis section does not limit or restrict the ability of the actual holder of the note to pursue any other claims or remedies it may have against the maker, the person who wrongly claimed to be the holder, or any person who facilitated or participated in the claim to the note or enforcement thereof.

History.âs. 7, ch. 2013-137.

702.12âActions in foreclosure.â

(1)(a)âA lienholder, in an action to foreclose a mortgage, may submit any document the defendant filed under penalty of perjury in the defendantâs bankruptcy case for use as an admission by the defendant.

(b)âA rebuttable presumption that the defendant has waived any defense to the foreclosure is created if a lienholder submits documents filed in the defendantâs bankruptcy case which:

1.âEvidence the defendantâs intention to surrender to the lienholder the property that is the subject of the foreclosure;

2.âHave not been withdrawn by the defendant; and

3.âShow that a final order has been entered in the defendantâs bankruptcy case which discharges the defendantâs debts or confirms the defendantâs repayment plan that provides for the surrender of the property.

(2)âPursuant to s. 90.203, a court shall take judicial notice of an order entered in a bankruptcy case upon the request of a lienholder.

(3)âThis section does not preclude the defendant in a foreclosure action from raising a defense based upon the lienholderâs action or inaction subsequent to the filing of the document filed in the bankruptcy case which evidenced the defendantâs intention to surrender the mortgaged property to the lienholder.

(4)âThis section applies to any foreclosure action filed on or after October 1, 2018.

(1)âThe Legislature intends that this section expedite the foreclosure process by ensuring initial disclosure of a plaintiffâs status and the facts supporting that status, thereby ensuring the availability of documents necessary to the prosecution of the case.

(2)âA complaint that seeks to foreclose a mortgage or other lien on residential real property, including individual units of condominiums and cooperatives, designed principally for occupation by from one to four families which secures a promissory note must:

(a)âContain affirmative allegations expressly made by the plaintiff at the time the proceeding is commenced that the plaintiff is the holder of the original note secured by the mortgage; or

(b)âAllege with specificity the factual basis by which the plaintiff is a person entitled to enforce the note under s. [673.3011](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/673.3011).

(3)âIf a plaintiff has been delegated the authority to institute a mortgage foreclosure action on behalf of the person entitled to enforce the note, the complaint shall describe the authority of the plaintiff and identify, with specificity, the document that grants the plaintiff the authority to act on behalf of the person entitled to enforce the note. This subsection is intended to require initial disclosure of status and pertinent facts and not to modify law regarding standing or real parties in interest. The term âoriginal noteâ or âoriginal promissory noteâ means the signed or executed promissory note rather than a copy thereof. The term includes any renewal, replacement, consolidation, or amended and restated note or instrument given in renewal, replacement, or substitution for a previous promissory note.

(4)âIf the plaintiff is in possession of the original promissory note, the plaintiff must file under penalty of perjury a certification with the court, contemporaneously with the filing of the complaint for foreclosure, that the plaintiff is in possession of the original promissory note. The certification must set forth the location of the note, the name and title of the individual giving the certification, the name of the person who personally verified such possession, and the time and date on which the possession was verified. Correct copies of the note and all allonges to the note must be attached to the certification. The original note and the allonges must be filed with the court before the entry of any judgment of foreclosure or judgment on the note.

(5)âIf the plaintiff seeks to enforce a lost, destroyed, or stolen instrument, an affidavit executed under penalty of perjury must be attached to the complaint. The affidavit must:

(a)âDetail a clear chain of all endorsements, transfers, or assignments of the promissory note that is the subject of the action.

(b)âSet forth facts showing that the plaintiff is entitled to enforce a lost, destroyed, or stolen instrument pursuant to s. [673.3091](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/673.3091). Adequate protection as required under s. [673.3091](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/673.3091)(2) shall be provided before the entry of final judgment.

(c)âInclude as exhibits to the affidavit such copies of the note and the allonges to the note, audit reports showing receipt of the original note, or other evidence of the acquisition, ownership, and possession of the note as may be available to the plaintiff.

(6)âThe court may sanction the plaintiff for failure to comply with this section.

(7)âThis section does not apply to any foreclosure proceeding involving timeshare interests under part III of chapter 721.

Source: [https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0702.036](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0702.036)

(1)âAs used in this section, the term âpropertyâ means real property.

(2)(a)âIn any action or proceeding in which a party seeks to set aside, invalidate, or challenge the validity of a final judgment of foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien, or to establish or reestablish a lien or encumbrance on the property in abrogation of the final judgment of foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien, the court shall treat such request solely as a claim for monetary damages and may not grant relief that adversely affects the quality or character of the title to the property, if:

1.âThe party seeking relief from the final judgment of foreclosure of the mortgage or lien was properly served in the foreclosure lawsuit as provided in chapter 48 or chapter 49.

2.âThe final judgment of foreclosure of the mortgage or lien was entered as to the property.

3.âAll applicable appeals periods have run as to the final judgment of foreclosure of the mortgage or lien with no appeals having been taken or any appeals having been finally resolved.

4.âThe property has been acquired for value, by a person not affiliated with the foreclosing mortgageholder, the foreclosing lienholder, or the foreclosed owner, at a time in which no lis pendens regarding the suit to set aside, invalidate, or challenge the foreclosure appears in the official records of the county where the property was located.

(b)âThis subsection does not limit the right to pursue any other relief to which a person may be entitled, including, but not limited to, compensatory damages, punitive damages, statutory damages, consequential damages, injunctive relief, or fees and costs, which does not adversely affect the ownership of the title to the property as vested in the unaffiliated purchaser for value.

(3)âFor purposes of this section, the following, without limitation, shall be considered persons affiliated with the foreclosing mortgageholder or foreclosing lienholder:

(a)âThe foreclosing mortgageholder, the foreclosing lienholder, or any loan servicer for the mortgage or lien being foreclosed;

(b)âAny past or present owner or holder of the mortgage or lien being foreclosed;

(c)âAny maintenance company, holding company, foreclosure services company, or law firm under contract to any entity listed in paragraph (a), paragraph (b), or this paragraph, with regard to the mortgage or lien being foreclosed; or

(d)âAny parent entity, subsidiary, or other person who directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, any entity listed in paragraph (a), paragraph (b), or paragraph (c).

(4)âAfter foreclosure of a mortgage based upon the enforcement of a lost, destroyed, or stolen note, a person who is not a party to the underlying foreclosure action but who claims to be the person entitled to enforce the promissory note secured by the foreclosed mortgage has no claim against the foreclosed property after it is conveyed for valuable consideration to a person not affiliated with the foreclosing lender or the foreclosed owner. This section does not preclude the person entitled to enforce the promissory note from pursuing recovery from any adequate protection given pursuant to s. [673.3091](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/673.3091) or from the party who wrongfully claimed to be the person entitled to enforce the promissory note under s. [702.11](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/702.11)(2) or otherwise, from the maker of the note, or from any other person against whom it may have a claim relating to the note.

(5)âIf a party seeks relief from a final judgment foreclosing a mortgage or lien, or files a separate action attacking such a final judgment, and the party claims that it holds or held a lien superior in right, priority, or dignity to the mortgage or lien foreclosed in the judgment, the court must award reasonable attorney fees to the party prevailing on the claim. This subsection applies whether the litigation seeking relief from the final judgment occurs in the case in which the judgment was entered or in any separate case or proceeding.

Mortgaged lands in different counties.

702.04âMortgaged lands in different counties.âWhen a mortgage includes lands, railroad track, right-of-way, or terminal facilities and station grounds, lying in two or more counties, it may be foreclosed in any one of said counties, and all proceedings shall be had in that county as if all the mortgaged land, railroad track, right-of-way, or terminal facilities and station grounds lay therein, except that notice of the sale must be published in every county wherein any of the lands, railroad track, right-of-way, or terminal facilities and station grounds to be sold lie. After final disposition of the suit, the clerk of the circuit court shall prepare and forward a certified copy of the decree of foreclosure and sale and of the decree of confirmation of sale to the clerk of the circuit court of every county wherein any of the mortgaged lands, railroad tracks, right-of-way, or terminal facilities and station grounds lie, to be recorded in the foreign judgment book of each such county, and the costs of such copies and of the record thereof shall be taxed as costs in the cause.

SECTION 06\
Deficiency decree; common-law suit to recover deficiency.

702.06âDeficiency decree; common-law suit to recover deficiency.âIn all suits for the foreclosure of mortgages heretofore or hereafter executed the entry of a deficiency decree for any portion of a deficiency, should one exist, shall be within the sound discretion of the court; however, in the case of an owner-occupied residential property, the amount of the deficiency may not exceed the difference between the judgment amount, or in the case of a short sale, the outstanding debt, and the fair market value of the property on the date of sale. For purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a residential property for which a homestead exemption for taxation was granted according to the certified rolls of the latest assessment by the county property appraiser, before the filing of the foreclosure action, is an owner-occupied residential property. The complainant shall also have the right to sue at common law to recover such deficiency, unless the court in the foreclosure action has granted or denied a claim for a deficiency judgment.

(1)âIn uncontested mortgage foreclosure proceedings in which the mortgagee waives the right to recoup any deficiency judgment, the court shall enter final judgment within 90 days from the date of the close of pleadings. For the purposes of this subsection, a mortgage foreclosure proceeding is uncontested if an answer not contesting the foreclosure has been filed or a default judgment has been entered by the court.

(2)âIn a mortgage foreclosure proceeding, when a default judgment has been entered against the mortgagor and the note or mortgage provides for the award of reasonable attorneyâs fees, it is not necessary for the court to hold a hearing or adjudge the requested attorneyâs fees to be reasonable if the fees do not exceed 3 percent of the principal amount owed at the time of filing the complaint, even if the note or mortgage does not specify the percentage of the original amount that would be paid as liquidated damages. Such fees constitute liquidated damages in any proceeding to enforce the note or mortgage. This section does not preclude a challenge to the reasonableness of the attorneyâs fees.

[702.07](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/702.07), the mortgage, together with its lien and the debt thereby secured, shall be, both in law and equity, completely relieved of all effects of any kind whatsoever resulting from or on account of the foreclosure proceedings and the decree of foreclosure and fully restored in all respects to the original status of the same as it existed prior to the foreclosure proceedings and the decree of foreclosure, and thereafter the same shall be for all purposes whatsoever legally of force and effect just as if foreclosure proceeding had never been instituted and a decree of foreclosure had never been made.

702.10âOrder to show cause; entry of final judgment of foreclosure; payment during foreclosure.â

(1)âA lienholder may request an order to show cause for the entry of final judgment in a foreclosure action. For purposes of this section, the term âlienholderâ includes the plaintiff and a defendant to the action who holds a lien encumbering the property or a defendant who, by virtue of its status as a condominium association, cooperative association, or property ownersâ association, may file a lien against the real property subject to foreclosure. Upon filing, the court shall immediately review the request and the court file in chambers and without a hearing. If, upon examination of the court file, the court finds that the complaint is verified, complies with s. [702.015](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/702.015), and alleges a cause of action to foreclose on real property, the court shall promptly issue an order directed to the other parties named in the action to show cause why a final judgment of foreclosure should not be entered.

(a)âThe order shall:

1.âSet the date and time for a hearing to show cause. The date for the hearing may not occur sooner than the later of 20 days after service of the order to show cause or 45 days after service of the initial complaint. When service is obtained by publication, the date for the hearing may not be set sooner than 30 days after the first publication.

2.âDirect the time within which service of the order to show cause and the complaint must be made upon the defendant.

3.âState that the filing of defenses by a motion, a responsive pleading, an affidavit, or other papers before the hearing to show cause that raise a genuine issue of material fact which would preclude the entry of summary judgment or otherwise constitute a legal defense to foreclosure shall constitute cause for the court not to enter final judgment.

4.âState that a defendant has the right to file affidavits or other papers before the time of the hearing to show cause and may appear personally or by way of an attorney at the hearing.

5.âState that, if a defendant files defenses by a motion, a verified or sworn answer, affidavits, or other papers or appears personally or by way of an attorney at the time of the hearing, the hearing time will be used to hear and consider whether the defendantâs motion, answer, affidavits, other papers, and other evidence and argument as may be presented by the defendant or the defendantâs attorney raise a genuine issue of material fact which would preclude the entry of summary judgment or otherwise constitute a legal defense to foreclosure. The order shall also state that the court may enter an order of final judgment of foreclosure at the hearing and order the clerk of the court to conduct a foreclosure sale.

6.âState that, if a defendant fails to appear at the hearing to show cause or fails to file defenses by a motion or by a verified or sworn answer or files an answer not contesting the foreclosure, such defendant may be considered to have waived the right to a hearing, and in such case, the court may enter a default against such defendant and, if appropriate, a final judgment of foreclosure ordering the clerk of the court to conduct a foreclosure sale.

7.âState that if the mortgage provides for reasonable attorney fees and the requested attorney fees do not exceed 3 percent of the principal amount owed at the time of filing the complaint, it is unnecessary for the court to hold a hearing or adjudge the requested attorney fees to be reasonable.

8.âAttach the form of the proposed final judgment of foreclosure which the movant requests the court to enter at the hearing on the order to show cause.

9.âRequire the party seeking final judgment to serve a copy of the order to show cause on the other parties in the following manner:

a.âIf a party has been served pursuant to chapter 48 with the complaint and original process, or the other party is the plaintiff in the action, service of the order to show cause on that party may be made in the manner provided in the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.

b.âIf a defendant has not been served pursuant to chapter 48 with the complaint and original process, the order to show cause, together with the summons and a copy of the complaint, shall be served on the party in the same manner as provided by law for original process.

Any final judgment of foreclosure entered under this subsection is for in rem relief only. This subsection does not preclude the entry of a deficiency judgment where otherwise allowed by law. The Legislature intends that this alternative procedure may run simultaneously with other court procedures.

(b)âThe right to be heard at the hearing to show cause is waived if a defendant, after being served as provided by law with an order to show cause, engages in conduct that clearly shows that the defendant has relinquished the right to be heard on that order. The defendantâs failure to file defenses by a motion or by a sworn or verified answer, affidavits, or other papers or to appear personally or by way of an attorney at the hearing duly scheduled on the order to show cause presumptively constitutes conduct that clearly shows that the defendant has relinquished the right to be heard. If a defendant files defenses by a motion, a verified answer, affidavits, or other papers or presents evidence at or before the hearing which raise a genuine issue of material fact which would preclude entry of summary judgment or otherwise constitute a legal defense to foreclosure, such action constitutes cause and precludes the entry of a final judgment at the hearing to show cause.

(c)âIn a mortgage foreclosure proceeding, when a final judgment of foreclosure has been entered against the mortgagor and the note or mortgage provides for the award of reasonable attorney fees, it is unnecessary for the court to hold a hearing or adjudge the requested attorney fees to be reasonable if the fees do not exceed 3 percent of the principal amount owed on the note or mortgage at the time of filing, even if the note or mortgage does not specify the percentage of the original amount that would be paid as liquidated damages.

(d)âIf the court finds that all defendants have waived the right to be heard as provided in paragraph (b), the court shall promptly enter a final judgment of foreclosure without the need for further hearing if the plaintiff has shown entitlement to a final judgment and upon the filing with the court of the original note, satisfaction of the conditions for establishment of a lost note, or upon a showing to the court that the obligation to be foreclosed is not evidenced by a promissory note or other negotiable instrument. If the court finds that a defendant has not waived the right to be heard on the order to show cause, the court shall determine whether there is cause not to enter a final judgment of foreclosure. If the court finds that the defendant has not shown cause, the court shall promptly enter a judgment of foreclosure. If the time allotted for the hearing is insufficient, the court may announce at the hearing a date and time for the continued hearing. Only the parties who appear, individually or through an attorney, at the initial hearing must be notified of the date and time of the continued hearing.

(2)âExcept as provided in paragraph (i), in any action for foreclosure, in addition to any other relief that the court may award, the plaintiff may request that the court enter an order directing the mortgagor defendant to show cause why an order to make payments during the pendency of the foreclosure proceedings or an order to vacate the premises should not be entered.

(a)âThe order shall:

1.âSet the date and time for hearing on the order to show cause. However, the date for the hearing may not be set sooner than 20 days after the service of the order. If service is obtained by publication, the date for the hearing may not be set sooner than 30 days after the first publication.

2.âDirect the time within which service of the order to show cause and the complaint shall be made upon each defendant.

3.âState that a defendant has the right to file affidavits or other papers at the time of the hearing and may appear personally or by way of an attorney at the hearing.

4.âState that, if a defendant fails to appear at the hearing to show cause and fails to file defenses by a motion or by a verified or sworn answer, the defendant is deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and in such case the court may enter an order to make payment or vacate the premises.

5.âRequire the movant to serve a copy of the order to show cause on the defendant in the following manner:

a.âIf a defendant has been served with the complaint and original process, service of the order may be made in the manner provided in the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.

b.âIf a defendant has not been served with the complaint and original process, the order to show cause, together with the summons and a copy of the complaint, shall be served on the defendant in the same manner as provided by law for original process.

(b)âThe right of a defendant to be heard at the hearing to show cause is waived if the defendant, after being served as provided by law with an order to show cause, engages in conduct that clearly shows that the defendant has relinquished the right to be heard on that order. A defendantâs failure to file defenses by a motion or by a sworn or verified answer or to appear at the hearing duly scheduled on the order to show cause presumptively constitutes conduct that clearly shows that the defendant has relinquished the right to be heard.

(c)âIf the court finds that a defendant has waived the right to be heard as provided in paragraph (b), the court may promptly enter an order requiring payment in the amount provided in paragraph (f) or an order to vacate.

(d)âIf the court finds that the mortgagor has not waived the right to be heard on the order to show cause, the court shall, at the hearing on the order to show cause, consider the affidavits and other showings made by the parties appearing and make a determination of the probable validity of the underlying claim alleged against the mortgagor and the mortgagorâs defenses. If the court determines that the plaintiff is likely to prevail in the foreclosure action, the court shall enter an order requiring the mortgagor to make the payment described in paragraph (e) to the plaintiff and provide for a remedy as described in paragraph (f). However, the order shall be stayed pending final adjudication of the claims of the parties if the mortgagor files with the court a written undertaking executed by a surety approved by the court in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the lien being foreclosed, including all principal, interest, unpaid taxes, and insurance premiums paid by the plaintiff.

(e)âIf the court enters an order requiring the mortgagor to make payments to the plaintiff, payments shall be payable at such intervals and in such amounts provided for in the mortgage instrument before acceleration or maturity. The obligation to make payments pursuant to any order entered under this subsection shall commence from the date of the motion filed under this section. The order shall be served upon the mortgagor no later than 20 days before the date specified for the first payment. The order may permit, but may not require, the plaintiff to take all appropriate steps to secure the premises during the pendency of the foreclosure action.

(f)âIf the court enters an order requiring payments, the order shall also provide that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the premises upon the failure of the mortgagor to make the payment required in the order unless at the hearing on the order to show cause the court finds good cause to order some other method of enforcement of its order.

(g)âAll amounts paid pursuant to this section shall be credited against the mortgage obligation in accordance with the terms of the loan documents; however, payments made under this section do not constitute a cure of any default or a waiver or any other defense to the mortgage foreclosure action.

(h)âUpon the filing of an affidavit with the clerk that the premises have not been vacated pursuant to the court order, the clerk shall issue to the sheriff a writ for possession which shall be governed by s. [83.62](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/83.62).

(i)âThis subsection does not apply to foreclosure of an owner-occupied residence. For purposes of this paragraph, there is a rebuttable presumption that a residential property for which a homestead exemption for taxation was granted according to the certified rolls of the latest assessment by the county property appraiser, before the filing of the foreclosure action, is an owner-occupied residential property.

(j)âFor purposes of this subsection, the term âmortgagorâ means a person who grants a mortgage or a successor in ownership of the real property described in the mortgage. The term does not include a homeownersâ association or an association, as those terms are defined in s. [720.301](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.301), or a corporation regulated under chapter 718 or chapter 719, that:

1.âAcquires title to a parcel or unit through the foreclosure of its claim of lien, or a deed in lieu of foreclosure, provided that title remains vested in the association or corporation and any rents collected are applied to assessments that are then due; or

2.âCollects rents from the tenants in the parcel or unit pursuant to s. [718.116](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.116)(11), s. [719.108](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.108)(10), or s. [720.3085](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.3085)(8).

(1)âIn connection with a mortgage foreclosure, the following constitute reasonable means of providing adequate protection under s. [673.3091](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/673.3091), if so found by the court:

(a)âA written indemnification agreement by a person reasonably believed sufficiently solvent to honor such an obligation;

In addition, the actual holder of the note may pursue recovery directly against any adequate protections given.

(a)âThe actual holder of the note is not required to pursue recovery against the maker of the note or any guarantor thereof as a condition precedent to pursuing remedies under this section.

(b)âThis section does not limit or restrict the ability of the actual holder of the note to pursue any other claims or remedies it may have against the maker, the person who wrongly claimed to be the holder, or any person who facilitated or participated in the claim to the note or enforcement thereof.

704.01âCommon-law and statutory easements defined and determined.â

(1)âIMPLIED GRANT OF WAY OF NECESSITY.âThe common-law rule of an implied grant of a way of necessity is hereby recognized, specifically adopted, and clarified. Such an implied grant exists where a person has heretofore granted or hereafter grants lands to which there is no accessible right-of-way except over her or his land, or has heretofore retained or hereafter retains land which is inaccessible except over the land which the person conveys. In such instances a right-of-way is presumed to have been granted or reserved. Such an implied grant or easement in lands or estates exists where there is no other reasonable and practicable way of egress, or ingress and same is reasonably necessary for the beneficial use or enjoyment of the part granted or reserved. An implied grant arises only where a unity of title exists from a common source other than the original grant from the state or United States; provided, however, that where there is a common source of title subsequent to the original grant from the state or United States, the right of the dominant tenement shall not be terminated if title of either the dominant or servient tenement has been or should be transferred for nonpayment of taxes either by foreclosure, reversion, or otherwise.

[1](#1)(2)âSTATUTORY WAY OF NECESSITY EXCLUSIVE OF COMMON-LAW RIGHT.âBased on public policy, convenience, and necessity, a statutory way of necessity exclusive of any common-law right exists when any land, including land formed by accretion, reliction, or other naturally occurring processes, or portion thereof, which is being used or is desired to be used for a dwelling or dwellings or for agricultural or for timber raising or cutting or stockraising purposes is shut off or hemmed in by lands, fencing, or other improvements by other persons so that no practicable route of egress or ingress is available therefrom to the nearest practicable public or private road in which the landlocked owner has vested easement rights. The owner or tenant thereof, or anyone in their behalf, lawfully may use and maintain an easement for persons, vehicles, stock, franchised cable television service, and any utility service, including, but not limited to, water, wastewater, reclaimed water, natural gas, electricity, and telephone service, over, under, through, and upon the lands which lie between the said shut-off or hemmed-in lands and such public or private road by means of the nearest practical route, considering the use to which said lands are being put; and the use thereof, as aforesaid, shall not constitute a trespass; nor shall the party thus using the same be liable in damages for the use thereof, provided that such easement shall be used only in an orderly and proper manner.

[1]()Note.âSection 2, ch. 2005-214, reenacted subsection (2) as it existed prior to amendment by s. 1, ch. 2005-214, â\[e]ffective only if a court determines that subsection (2)â.â.â.â, as amended by \[s. 1, ch. 2005-214], is unconstitutional and such determination is upheld on appeal,â to read:

(2)âSTATUTORY WAY OF NECESSITY EXCLUSIVE OF COMMON-LAW RIGHT.âBased on public policy, convenience, and necessity, a statutory way of necessity exclusive of any common-law right exists when any land or portion thereof outside any municipality which is being used or desired to be used for a dwelling or dwellings or for agricultural or for timber raising or cutting or stockraising purposes shall be shut off or hemmed in by lands, fencing, or other improvements of other persons so that no practicable route of egress or ingress shall be available therefrom to the nearest practicable public or private road. The owner or tenant thereof, or anyone in their behalf, lawfully may use and maintain an easement for persons, vehicles, stock, franchised cable television service, and any utility service, including, but not limited to, water, wastewater, reclaimed water, natural gas, electricity, and telephone service, over, under, through, and upon the lands which lie between the said shut-off or hemmed-in lands and such public or private road by means of the nearest practical route, considering the use to which said lands are being put; and the use thereof, as aforesaid, shall not constitute a trespass; nor shall the party thus using the same be liable in damages for the use thereof; provided that such easement shall be used only in an orderly and proper manner.

When said easement is awarded to the owner of the dominant tenement, it shall be in compliance with s. [704.01](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/704.01)(2) and shall exist so long as such easement is reasonably necessary. The court, in its discretion, shall determine all questions, including the type, duration, extent, and location of the easement, the amount of compensation, and the attorneyâs fees and costs to be awarded to either party for unreasonable refusal to comply with the provisions of s.

704.06âConservation easements; creation; acquisition; enforcement.â

(1)âAs used in this section, âconservation easementâ means a right or interest in real property which is appropriate to retaining land or water areas predominantly in their natural, scenic, open, agricultural, or wooded condition; retaining such areas as suitable habitat for fish, plants, or wildlife; retaining the structural integrity or physical appearance of sites or properties of historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural significance, including abandoned and neglected cemeteries that are 50 or more years old; or maintaining existing land uses and which prohibits or limits any or all of the following:

(a)âConstruction or placing of buildings, roads, signs, billboards or other advertising, utilities, or other structures on or above the ground.

(b)âDumping or placing of soil or other substance or material as landfill or dumping or placing of trash, waste, or unsightly or offensive materials.

(c)âRemoval or destruction of trees, shrubs, or other vegetation.

(d)âExcavation, dredging, or removal of loam, peat, gravel, soil, rock, or other material substance in such manner as to affect the surface.

(e)âSurface use except for purposes that permit the land or water area to remain predominantly in its natural condition.

(f)âActivities detrimental to drainage, flood control, water conservation, erosion control, soil conservation, or fish and wildlife habitat preservation.

(g)âActs or uses detrimental to such retention of land or water areas.

(h)âActs or uses detrimental to the preservation of the structural integrity or physical appearance of sites or properties of historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural significance, including abandoned and neglected cemeteries that are 50 or more years old.

(2)âConservation easements are perpetual, undivided interests in property and may be created or stated in the form of a restriction, easement, covenant, or condition in any deed, will, or other instrument executed by or on behalf of the owner of the property, or in any order of taking. Such easements may be acquired in the same manner as other interests in property are acquired, except by condemnation or by other exercise of the power of eminent domain, and shall not be unassignable to other governmental bodies or agencies, charitable organizations, or trusts authorized to acquire such easements, for lack of benefit to a dominant estate.

(3)âConservation easements may be acquired by any governmental body or agency or by a charitable corporation or trust whose purposes include protecting natural, scenic, or open space values of real property, assuring its availability for agricultural, forest, recreational, or open space use, protecting natural resources, maintaining or enhancing air or water quality, or preserving sites or properties of historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural significance, including abandoned and neglected cemeteries that are 50 or more years old.

(4)âConservation easements shall run with the land and be binding on all subsequent owners of the servient estate. Notwithstanding the provisions of s. [197.552](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/197.552), all provisions of a conservation easement shall survive and are enforceable after the issuance of a tax deed. No conservation easement shall be unenforceable on account of lack of privity of contract or lack of benefit to particular land or on account of the benefit being assignable. Conservation easements may be enforced by injunction or proceeding in equity or at law, and shall entitle the holder to enter the land in a reasonable manner and at reasonable times to assure compliance. A conservation easement may be released by the holder of the easement to the holder of the fee even though the holder of the fee may not be a governmental body or a charitable corporation or trust.

(5)âAll conservation easements shall be recorded and indexed in the same manner as any other instrument affecting the title to real property.

(6)âThe provisions of this section shall not be construed to imply that any restriction, easement, covenant, or condition which does not have the benefit of this section shall, on account of any provision hereof, be unenforceable.

(7)âRecording of the conservation easement shall be notice to the property appraiser and tax collector of the county of the conveyance of the conservation easement.

(8)âConservation easements may provide for a third-party right of enforcement. As used in this section, third-party right of enforcement means a right provided in a conservation easement to enforce any of its terms granted to a governmental body, or charitable corporation or trust as described in subsection (3), which although eligible to be a holder, is not a holder.

(9)âAn action affecting a conservation easement may be brought by:

(a)âAn owner of an interest in the real property burdened by the easement;

(b)âA holder of the easement;

(c)âA person having a third-party right of enforcement; or

(d)âA person authorized by another law.

(10)âThe ownership or attempted enforcement of rights held by the holder of an easement does not subject the holder to any liability for any damage or injury that may be suffered by any person on the property or as a result of the condition of the property encumbered by a conservation easement.

(11)(a)âThis section or other provisions of law may not be construed to prohibit or limit the owner of land, or the owner of a conservation easement over land, to voluntarily negotiate the sale or use of such lands or easement for the construction and operation of linear facilities, including electric transmission and distribution facilities, telecommunications transmission and distribution facilities, pipeline transmission and distribution facilities, public transportation corridors, and related appurtenances, nor does this section prohibit the use of eminent domain for said purposes as established by law. In any legal proceeding to condemn land for the purpose of construction and operation of a linear facility as described above, the court shall consider the public benefit provided by the conservation easement and linear facilities in determining which lands may be taken and the compensation paid.

(b)âFor any land that has traditionally been used for agriculture, as that term is defined in s. [570.02](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/570.02), and is subject to a conservation easement entered into at any time pursuant to s. [570.71](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/570.71), this section or s. [570.71](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/570.71) may not be construed to limit the owner of the land to voluntarily negotiating the use of the land for any public or private linear facility, right of access, and related appurtenances, and reasonable compensation based on diminution in value of its interest in the conservation easement shall be the only remedy to the owner of the conservation easement for the construction and operation of any public or private linear facilities and related access and appurtenances.

(c)âThis section does not preclude the applicability of any environmental permitting requirements applicable to a linear facility pursuant to chapters 369-380 or chapter 403 or any agency rules adopted pursuant to those chapters.

(12)âAn owner of property encumbered by a conservation easement must abide by the requirements of chapter 712 or any other similar law or rule to preserve the conservation easement in perpetuity.

(13)âA conservation easement agreement may include provisions which allow agricultural activities, including, but not limited to, silviculture, forestry management, and livestock grazing, if such activity is a current or historic use of the land placed under easement. If such agricultural activities are allowed under the terms of the agreement, such activities must be conducted in accordance with applicable best management practices adopted by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. This subsection does not restrict or diminish the authority granted in a previous conservation easement agreement for forest management and livestock grazing as a compatible use on lands subject to a conservation easement.

705.103âProcedure for abandoned or lost property.â

(1)âWhenever a law enforcement officer ascertains that an article of lost or abandoned property is present on public property and is of such nature that it can be easily removed, the officer shall take such article into custody and shall make a reasonable attempt to ascertain the rightful owner or lienholder pursuant to the provisions of this section.

(2)(a)1.âWhenever a law enforcement officer ascertains that:

a.âAn article of lost or abandoned property other than a derelict vessel or a vessel declared a public nuisance pursuant to s. [327.73](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/327.73)(1)(aa) is present on public property and is of such nature that it cannot be easily removed, the officer shall cause a notice to be placed upon such article in substantially the following form:

NOTICE TO THE OWNER AND ALL PERSONS INTERESTED IN THE ATTACHED PROPERTY. This property, to wit: Â Â (setting forth brief description)Â Â  is unlawfully upon public property known as Â Â (setting forth brief description of location)Â Â  and must be removed within 5 days; otherwise, it will be removed and disposed of pursuant to chapter 705, Florida Statutes. The owner will be liable for the costs of removal, storage, and publication of notice. Dated this: Â Â (setting forth the date of posting of notice)Â Â , signed: Â Â (setting forth name, title, address, and telephone number of law enforcement officer)Â Â .

b.âA derelict vessel or a vessel declared a public nuisance pursuant to s. [327.73](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/327.73)(1)(aa) is present on the waters of this state, the officer shall cause a notice to be placed upon such vessel in substantially the following form:

NOTICE TO THE OWNER AND ALL PERSONS INTERESTED IN THE ATTACHED VESSEL. This vessel, to wit: Â Â (setting forth brief description of location)Â Â  has been determined to be Â Â (derelict or a public nuisance)Â Â  and is unlawfully upon the waters of this state Â Â (setting forth brief description of location)Â Â  and must be removed within 21 days; otherwise, it will be removed and disposed of pursuant to chapter 705, Florida Statutes. The owner and other interested parties have the right to a hearing to challenge the determination that this vessel is derelict or otherwise in violation of the law. Please contact Â Â (contact information for person who can arrange for a hearing in accordance with this section)Â Â . The owner or the party determined to be legally responsible for the vessel being upon the waters of this state in a derelict condition or as a public nuisance will be liable for the costs of removal, destruction, and disposal if this vessel is not removed by the owner. Dated this: Â Â (setting forth the date of posting of notice)Â Â , signed: Â Â (setting forth name, title, address, and telephone number of law enforcement officer)Â Â .

2.âThe notices required under subparagraph 1. may not be less than 8 inches by 10 inches and must be sufficiently weatherproof to withstand normal exposure to the elements. In addition to posting, the law enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to ascertain the name and address of the owner. If such is reasonably available to the officer, she or he shall mail a copy of such notice to the owner on or before the date of posting. If the property is a motor vehicle as defined in s. [320.01](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.01)(1) or a vessel as defined in s. [327.02](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/327.02), the law enforcement agency shall contact the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles in order to determine the name and address of the owner and any person who has filed a lien on the vehicle or vessel as provided in s. [319.27](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/319.27)(2) or (3) or s. [328.15](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/328.15). On receipt of this information, the law enforcement agency shall mail a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner and to the lienholder, if any, except that a law enforcement officer who has issued a citation for a violation of s. [823.11](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/823.11) to the owner of a derelict vessel is not required to mail a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner. For a derelict vessel or a vessel declared a public nuisance pursuant to s. [327.73](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/327.73)(1)(aa), the mailed notice must inform the owner or responsible party that he or she has a right to a hearing to dispute the determination that the vessel is derelict or otherwise in violation of the law. If a request for a hearing is made, a state agency shall follow the processes as set forth in s. [120.569](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/120.569). Local governmental entities shall follow the processes set forth in s. [120.569](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/120.569), except that a local judge, magistrate, or code enforcement officer may be designated to conduct such a hearing. If, at the end of 5 days after posting the notice in sub-subparagraph 1.a., or at the end of 21 days after posting the notice in sub-subparagraph 1.b., and mailing such notice, if required, the owner or any person interested in the lost or abandoned article or articles described has not removed the article or articles from public property or shown reasonable cause for failure to do so, and, in the case of a derelict vessel or a vessel declared a public nuisance pursuant to s. [327.73](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/327.73)(1)(aa), has not requested a hearing in accordance with this section, the following shall apply:

a.âFor abandoned property other than a derelict vessel or a vessel declared a public nuisance pursuant to s. [327.73](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/327.73)(1)(aa), the law enforcement agency may retain any or all of the property for its own use or for use by the state or unit of local government, trade such property to another unit of local government or state agency, donate the property to a charitable organization, sell the property, or notify the appropriate refuse removal service.

b.âFor a derelict vessel or a vessel declared a public nuisance pursuant to s. [327.73](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/327.73)(1)(aa), the law enforcement agency or its designee may:

(I)âRemove the vessel from the waters of this state and destroy and dispose of the vessel or authorize another governmental entity or its designee to do so; or

(II)âAuthorize the vesselâs use as an artificial reef in accordance with s. [379.249](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/379.249) if all necessary federal, state, and local authorizations are received.

A law enforcement agency or its designee may also take action as described in this sub-subparagraph if, following a hearing pursuant to this section, the judge, magistrate, administrative law judge, or hearing officer has determined the vessel to be derelict as provided in s. [823.11](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/823.11) or otherwise in violation of the law in accordance with s. [327.73](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/327.73)(1)(aa) and a final order has been entered or the case is otherwise closed.

(b)âFor lost property, the officer shall take custody and the agency shall retain custody of the property for 90 days. The agency shall publish notice of the intended disposition of the property, as provided in this section, during the first 45 days of this time period.

1.âIf the agency elects to retain the property for use by the unit of government, donate the property to a charitable organization, surrender such property to the finder, sell the property, or trade the property to another unit of local government or state agency, notice of such election shall be given by an advertisement published once a week for 2 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the property was found if the value of the property is more than $100. If the value of the property is $100 or less, notice shall be given by posting a description of the property at the law enforcement agency where the property was turned in. The notice must be posted for not less than 2 consecutive weeks in a public place designated by the law enforcement agency. The notice must describe the property in a manner reasonably adequate to permit the rightful owner of the property to claim it.

2.âIf the agency elects to sell the property, it must do so at public sale by competitive bidding. Notice of the time and place of the sale shall be given by an advertisement of the sale published once a week for 2 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the sale is to be held. The notice shall include a statement that the sale shall be subject to any and all liens. The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to that where the lost or abandoned property is held or stored. The advertisement must include a description of the goods and the time and place of the sale. The sale may take place no earlier than 10 days after the final publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county where the sale is to be held, the advertisement shall be posted at the door of the courthouse and at three other public places in the county at least 10 days prior to sale. Notice of the agencyâs intended disposition shall describe the property in a manner reasonably adequate to permit the rightful owner of the property to identify it.

(3)âIf the property is sold at public sale pursuant to subparagraph (2)(b)2., the agency shall deduct from the proceeds the costs of transportation, storage, and publication of notice, and any balance of proceeds shall be deposited into an interest-bearing account not later than 30 days after the date of the sale and held there for 1 year. The agency shall provide a bill of sale clearly stating that the sale is subject to any and all liens.

1.ââAbandoned aircraftâ means an aircraft that has been disposed of on a public-use airport in a wrecked, inoperative, or partially dismantled condition or an aircraft that has remained in an idle state on premises owned or controlled by the operator of a public-use airport for 45 consecutive calendar days.

Within 10 business days after receipt of the information, the director or the directorâs designee shall notify the owner and all persons having an equitable or legal interest in the aircraft by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the location of the derelict or abandoned aircraft on the airport premises, that fees and charges for the use of the airport by the aircraft have accrued and the amount thereof, that the aircraft is subject to a lien under subsection (5) for the accrued fees and charges for the use of the airport and for the transportation, storage, and removal of the aircraft, that the lien is subject to enforcement pursuant to law, and that the airport may cause the use, trade, sale, or removal of the aircraft as described in s.

Such notice may require removal of the aircraft in less than 30 calendar days if the aircraft poses a danger to the health or safety of users of the airport, as determined by the director or the directorâs designee.

(3)âIf the owner of the aircraft is unknown or cannot be found, the director or the directorâs designee shall cause a laminated notice to be placed upon such aircraft in substantially the following form:

NOTICE TO THE OWNER AND ALL PERSONS INTERESTED IN THE ATTACHED PROPERTY. This property, to wit: Â Â (setting forth brief description)Â Â  is unlawfully upon public property known as Â Â (setting forth brief description of location)Â Â  and has accrued fees and charges for the use of the Â Â (same description of location as above)Â Â  and for the transportation, storage, and removal of the property.

Such notice shall be not less than 8 inches by 10 inches and shall be sufficiently weatherproof to withstand normal exposure to the weather. If, at the end of 30 calendar days after posting the notice, the owner or any person interested in the described derelict or abandoned aircraft has not removed the aircraft from the airport upon payment in full of all accrued fees and charges for the use of the airport and for the transportation, storage, and removal of the aircraft, or shown reasonable cause for failure to do so, the director or the directorâs designee may cause the use, trade, sale, or removal of the aircraft as described in s. [705.182](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/705.182)(2)(a), (b), (d), or (e).

(4)âSuch aircraft shall be removed within the time period specified in the notice provided under subsection (2) or subsection (3). If, at the end of such period of time, the owner or any person interested in the described derelict or abandoned aircraft has not removed the aircraft from the airport upon payment in full of all accrued fees and charges for the use of the airport and for the transportation, storage, and removal of the aircraft, or shown reasonable cause for the failure to do so, the director or the directorâs designee may cause the use, trade, sale, or removal of the aircraft as described in s. [705.182](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/705.182)(2)(a), (b), (d), or (e).

(a)âIf the airport elects to sell the aircraft in accordance with s. [705.182](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/705.182)(2)(d), the aircraft must be sold at public auction after giving notice of the time and place of sale, at least 10 calendar days prior to the date of sale, in a publication of general circulation within the county where the airport is located and after providing written notice of the intended sale to all parties known to have an interest in the aircraft.

(b)âIf the airport elects to dispose of the aircraft in accordance with s. [705.182](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/705.182)(2)(e), the airport shall be entitled to negotiate with the company for a price to be received from such company in payment for the aircraft, or, if circumstances so warrant, a price to be paid to such company by the airport for the costs of disposing of the aircraft. All information pertaining to the establishment of such price and the justification for the amount of such price shall be prepared and maintained by the airport, and such negotiated price shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonable price.

(c)âIf the sale price or the negotiated price is less than the airportâs then current charges and costs against the aircraft, or if the airport is required to pay the salvage company for its services, the owner of the aircraft shall remain liable to the airport for the airportâs costs that are not offset by the sale price or negotiated price, in addition to the ownerâs liability for payment to the airport of the price the airport was required to pay any salvage company. All costs incurred by the airport in the removal, storage, and sale of any aircraft shall be recoverable against the owner of the aircraft.

(5)âThe airport shall have a lien on a derelict or abandoned aircraft for all fees and charges for the use of the airport by such aircraft and for all fees and charges incurred by the airport for the transportation, storage, and removal of the aircraft. As a prerequisite to perfecting a lien under this section, the airport director or the directorâs designee must serve a notice in accordance with subsection (2) on the last registered owner and all persons having an equitable or legal interest in the aircraft. Serving the notice does not dispense with recording the claim of lien.

(6)(a)âFor the purpose of perfecting its lien under this section, the airport shall record a claim of lien which shall state:

1.âThe name and address of the airport.

2.âThe name of the last registered owner of the aircraft and all persons having a legal or equitable interest in the aircraft.

3.âThe fees and charges incurred by the aircraft for the use of the airport and the fees and charges for the transportation, storage, and removal of the aircraft.

4.âA description of the aircraft sufficient for identification.

(b)âThe claim of lien shall be signed and sworn to or affirmed by the airport director or the directorâs designee.

Personally KnownÂ OR ProducedÂ as identification.

However, the negligent inclusion or omission of any information in this claim of lien which does not prejudice the last registered owner does not constitute a default that operates to defeat an otherwise valid lien.

(e)âThe claim of lien shall be recorded with the clerk of court in the county where the airport is located.

If the motor vehicle is to be removed from airport premises by the airportâs wrecker, the airport must follow the procedures in subsections (2)-(8). The procedures in subsections (2)-(8) do not apply if the motor vehicle is removed from the airport premises by a licensed independent wrecker company, and the licensed wrecking company shall comply with s. [713.78](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.78).

(2)âThe airport director or the directorâs designee shall contact the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to notify that department that the airport has possession of the abandoned or derelict motor vehicle and to determine the name and address of the owner of the motor vehicle, the insurance company insuring the motor vehicle, notwithstanding the provisions of s.

[627.736](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/627.736), and all persons of record claiming a lien against the motor vehicle. The notice shall state the fact of possession of the motor vehicle, that charges for reasonable towing, storage, and parking fees, if any, have accrued and the amount thereof, that a lien as provided in subsection (6) will be claimed, that the lien is subject to enforcement pursuant to law, that the owner or lienholder, if any, has the right to a hearing as set forth in subsection (4), and that any motor vehicle which, at the end of 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice, has not been removed from the airport upon payment in full of all accrued charges for reasonable towing, storage, and parking fees, if any, may be disposed of as provided in s.

(b)âUpon filing a complaint, an owner or lienholder may have his or her motor vehicle released upon posting with the court a cash or surety bond or other adequate security equal to the amount of the fees for towing, storage, and accrued parking, if any, to ensure the payment of such fees in the event he or she does not prevail. Upon the posting of the bond or other adequate security and the payment of any applicable fee, the clerk of the court shall issue a certificate notifying the airport of the posting of the bond or other adequate security and directing the airport to release the motor vehicle. At the time of such release, after reasonable inspection, the owner or lienholder shall give a receipt to the airport reciting any claims he or she has for loss or damage to the motor vehicle or the contents of the motor vehicle.

(5)âIf, after 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice, the owner or any person claiming a lien has not removed the motor vehicle from its storage location upon payment in full of all accrued charges for reasonable towing, storage, and parking fees, if any, or shown reasonable cause for the failure to do so, the airport director or the directorâs designee may dispose of the motor vehicle as provided in s. [705.182](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/705.182)(2)(a), (b), (d), or (e). If the airport elects to sell the motor vehicle pursuant to s. [705.182](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/705.182)(2)(d), the motor vehicle may be sold free of all prior liens after 35 calendar days after the time the motor vehicle is stored if any prior liens on the motor vehicle are more than 5 years of age or after 50 calendar days after the time the motor vehicle is stored if any prior liens on the motor vehicle are 5 years of age or less. The sale shall be a public auction either on the Internet or at a specified physical location. If the date of the sale was not included in the notice required in subsection (2), notice of the sale, sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, shall be given to the owner of the motor vehicle and to all persons claiming a lien on the motor vehicle. Such notice shall be mailed not less than 10 calendar days before the date of the sale. In addition to the notice by mail, public notice of the time and place of the sale at auction shall be made by publishing a notice of the sale at auction one time, at least 10 calendar days prior to the date of sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the sale is to be held. All costs incurred by the airport for the towing, storage, and sale of the motor vehicle, as well as all accrued parking fees, if any, shall be recovered by the airport from the proceeds of the sale, and any proceeds of the sale in excess of such costs shall be retained by the airport for use by the airport in any manner authorized by law.

(6)âThe airport pursuant to this section or, if used, a licensed independent wrecker company pursuant to s. [713.78](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.78) shall have a lien on an abandoned or derelict motor vehicle for all reasonable towing, storage, and accrued parking fees, if any, except that no storage fee shall be charged if the motor vehicle is stored less than 6 hours. As a prerequisite to perfecting a lien under this section, the airport director or the directorâs designee must serve a notice in accordance with subsection (2) on the owner of the motor vehicle, the insurance company insuring the motor vehicle, notwithstanding the provisions of s. [627.736](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/627.736), and all persons of record claiming a lien against the motor vehicle. If attempts to notify the owner, the insurance company insuring the motor vehicle, notwithstanding the provisions of s. [627.736](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/627.736), or lienholders are not successful, the requirement of notice by mail shall be considered met. Serving of the notice does not dispense with recording the claim of lien.

(7)(a)âFor the purpose of perfecting its lien under this section, the airport shall record a claim of lien which shall state:

1.âThe name and address of the airport.

2.âThe name of the owner of the motor vehicle, the insurance company insuring the motor vehicle, notwithstanding the provisions of s. [627.736](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/627.736), and all persons of record claiming a lien against the motor vehicle.

3.âThe costs incurred from reasonable towing, storage, and parking fees, if any.

4.âA description of the motor vehicle sufficient for identification.

(b)âThe claim of lien shall be signed and sworn to or affirmed by the airport director or the directorâs designee.

(c)âThe claim of lien shall be sufficient if it is in substantially the following form:

CLAIM OF LIEN

Â Â (Description of motor vehicle)Â Â

Â Â (Signature of Notary Public)Â Â âÂ Â (Print, Type, or Stamp Commissioned name of Notary Public)Â Â 

Personally KnownÂ OR ProducedÂ as identification.

However, the negligent inclusion or omission of any information in this claim of lien which does not prejudice the owner does not constitute a default that operates to defeat an otherwise valid lien.

(d)âThe claim of lien shall be served on the owner of the motor vehicle, the insurance company insuring the motor vehicle, notwithstanding the provisions of s. [627.736](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/627.736), and all persons of record claiming a lien against the motor vehicle. If attempts to notify the owner, the insurance company insuring the motor vehicle notwithstanding the provisions of s. [627.736](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/627.736), or lienholders are not successful, the requirement of notice by mail shall be considered met. The claim of lien shall be so served before recordation.

(e)âThe claim of lien shall be recorded with the clerk of court in the county where the airport is located. The recording of the claim of lien shall be constructive notice to all persons of the contents and effect of such claim. The lien shall attach at the time of recordation and shall take priority as of that time.

(8)âA purchaser or recipient in good faith of a motor vehicle sold or obtained under this section takes the property free of the rights of persons then holding any legal or equitable interest thereto, whether or not recorded.

(1)âExcept as provided in this section, a power of attorney is exercisable when executed.

(2)âIf a power of attorney executed before October 1, 2011, is conditioned on the principalâs lack of capacity and the power of attorney has not become exercisable before that date, the power of attorney is exercisable upon the delivery of the affidavit of a physician who has primary responsibility for the treatment and care of the principal and who is licensed to practice medicine or osteopathic medicine pursuant to chapter 458 or chapter 459 as of the date of the affidavit. The affidavit executed by the physician must state that the physician is licensed to practice medicine or osteopathic medicine pursuant to chapter 458 or chapter 459, that the physician is the primary physician who has responsibility for the treatment and care of the principal, and that the physician believes that the principal lacks the capacity to manage property.

(1)âA power of attorney terminates when:

(a)âThe principal dies;

(b)âThe principal becomes incapacitated, if the power of attorney is not durable;

(c)âThe principal is adjudicated totally or partially incapacitated by a court, unless the court determines that certain authority granted by the power of attorney is to be exercisable by the agent;

(d)âThe principal revokes the power of attorney;

(e)âThe power of attorney provides that it terminates;

(f)âThe purpose of the power of attorney is accomplished; or

(g)âThe agentâs authority terminates and the power of attorney does not provide for another agent to act under the power of attorney.

(2)âAn agentâs authority is exercisable until the authority terminates. An agentâs authority terminates when:

(a)âThe agent dies, becomes incapacitated, resigns, or is removed by a court;

(b)âAn action is filed for the dissolution or annulment of the agentâs marriage to the principal or for their legal separation, unless the power of attorney otherwise provides; or

(c)âThe power of attorney terminates.

(3)âIf any person initiates judicial proceedings to determine the principalâs incapacity or for the appointment of a guardian advocate, the authority granted under the power of attorney is suspended until the petition is dismissed or withdrawn or the court enters an order authorizing the agent to exercise one or more powers granted under the power of attorney. However, if the agent named in the power of attorney is the principalâs parent, spouse, child, or grandchild, the authority under the power of attorney is not suspended unless a verified motion in accordance with s. [744.3203](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/744.3203) is also filed.

(a)âIf an emergency arises after initiation of proceedings to determine incapacity and before adjudication regarding the principalâs capacity, the agent may petition the court in which the proceeding is pending for authorization to exercise a power granted under the power of attorney. The petition must set forth the nature of the emergency, the property or matter involved, and the power to be exercised by the agent.

(b)âNotwithstanding the provisions of this section, unless otherwise ordered by the court, a proceeding to determine incapacity does not affect the authority of the agent to make health care decisions for the principal, including, but not limited to, those provided in chapter 765. If the principal has executed a health care advance directive designating a health care surrogate, the terms of the directive control if the directive and the power of attorney are in conflict unless the power of attorney is later executed and expressly states otherwise.

(4)âTermination or suspension of an agentâs authority or of a power of attorney is not effective as to an agent who, without knowledge of the termination or suspension, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. An act so performed, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principalâs successors in interest.

(1)âA person nominated under s. [710.104](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/710.104) or designated under s. [710.111](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/710.111) as custodian may decline to serve by delivering a valid disclaimer under chapter 739 to the person who made the nomination or to the transferor or the transferorâs legal representative.

[710.104](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/710.104), the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute custodian under s.

[710.105](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/710.105) as successor custodian by executing and dating an instrument of designation before a subscribing witness other than the successor. If the instrument of designation does not contain or is not accompanied by the resignation of the custodian, the designation of the successor does not take effect until the custodian resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated, or is removed.

(3)âA custodian may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the minor if the minor has attained the age of 14 years and to the successor custodian and by delivering the custodial property to the successor custodian.

(4)âIf a custodian is ineligible, dies, or becomes incapacitated without having effectively designated a successor and the minor has attained the age of 14 years, the minor may designate as successor custodian, in the manner prescribed in subsection (2), an adult member of the minorâs family, a conservator of the minor, or a trust company. If the minor has not attained the age of 14 years or fails to act within 60 days after the ineligibility, death, or incapacity, the conservator of the minor becomes successor custodian.

(1)âThe custodian shall transfer in an appropriate manner the custodial property to the minor or to the minorâs estate upon the earlier of:

(a)âThe minorâs attainment of 21 years of age with respect to custodial property transferred under s. [710.105](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/710.105) or s. [710.106](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/710.106). However, a transferor can, with respect to such custodial property, create the custodianship so that it terminates when the minor attains 25 years of age;

(b)âThe minorâs attainment of 18 years of age with respect to custodial property transferred under s. [710.107](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/710.107) or s. [710.108](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/710.108); or

(c)âThe minorâs death.

(2)âIf the transferor of a custodianship under paragraph (1)(a) creates the custodianship to terminate when the minor attains 25 years of age, in the case of a custodianship created by irrevocable gift or by irrevocable inter vivos exercise of a general power of appointment, the minor nevertheless has the absolute right to compel immediate distribution of the entire custodial property when the minor attains 21 years of age.

(3)âAs to a custodianship described in subsection (2), a transferor may provide, by delivery of a written instrument to the custodian upon the creation of such custodianship, that the minorâs right to compel immediate distribution of the entire custodial property will terminate upon the expiration of a fixed period that begins with the custodianâs delivery of a written notice to the minor of the existence of such right.

711.502âRegistration in beneficiary form; sole or joint tenancy ownership.âOnly individuals whose registration of a security shows sole ownership by one individual or multiple ownership by two or more with right of survivorship, rather than as tenants in common, may obtain registration in beneficiary form. Multiple owners of a security registered in beneficiary form hold as joint tenants with right of survivorship, as tenants by the entireties, or as owners of community property held in survivorship form, and not as tenants in common.

History.âs. 3, ch. 94-216.

711.503âRegistration in beneficiary form; applicable law.âA security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this or a similar statute of the state of organization of the issuer or registering entity, the location of the registering entityâs principal office, the office of its transfer agent or its office making the registration, or by this or a similar statute of the law of the state listed as the ownerâs address at the time of registration. A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this or similar legislation is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law.

History.âs. 3, ch. 94-216.

711.504âOrigination of registration in beneficiary form.âA security, whether evidenced by certificate or account, is registered in beneficiary form when the registration includes a designation of a beneficiary to take the ownership at the death of the owner or the deaths of all multiple owners.

History.âs. 3, ch. 94-216.

History.âs. 3, ch. 94-216.

711.506âEffect of registration in beneficiary form.âThe designation of a transfer-on-death beneficiary on a registration in beneficiary form has no effect on ownership until the ownerâs death. A registration of a security in beneficiary form may be canceled or changed at any time by the sole owner or all then-surviving owners without the consent of the beneficiary.

History.âs. 3, ch. 94-216.

711.507âOwnership on death of owner.âOn death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

History.âs. 3, ch. 94-216.

711.508âProtection of registering entity.â

(1)âA registering entity is not required to offer or to accept a request for security registration in beneficiary form. If a registration in beneficiary form is offered by a registering entity, the owner requesting registration in beneficiary form assents to the protections given to the registering entity by ss. 711.50-711.512.

(2)âBy accepting a request for registration of a security in beneficiary form, the registering entity agrees that the registration will be implemented on death of the deceased owner as provided in ss. 711.50-711.512.

(3)âA registering entity is discharged from all claims to a security by the estate, creditors, heirs, or devisees of a deceased owner if it registers a transfer of the security in accordance with s. 711.507 and does so in good faith reliance on the registration, on ss. 711.50-711.512, and on information provided to it by affidavit of the personal representative of the deceased owner, or by the surviving beneficiary or by the surviving beneficiaryâs representatives, or other information available to the registering entity. The protections of ss. 711.50-711.512 do not extend to a reregistration or payment made after a registering entity has received written notice from any claimant to any interest in the security objecting to implementation of a registration in beneficiary form. No other notice or other information available to the registering entity affects its right to protection under ss. 711.50-711.512.

(4)âThe protection provided by ss. 711.50-711.512 to the registering entity of a security does not affect the rights of beneficiaries in disputes between themselves and other claimants to ownership of the security transferred or its value or proceeds.

History.âs. 3, ch. 94-216.

711.509âNontestamentary transfer on death.â

The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiaryâs descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiaryâs death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters âLDPS,â standing for âlineal descendants per stirpes.â This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiaryâs descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiaryâs domicile at the ownerâs death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entityâs terms and conditions.

(2)âThe following are illustrations of registrations in beneficiary form which a registering entity may authorize:

Any person having the legal capacity to own land in this state, who, alone or together with her or his predecessors in title, has been vested with any estate in land of record for 30 years or more, shall have a marketable record title to such estate in said land, which shall be free and clear of all claims except the matters set forth as exceptions to marketability in s. [712.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/712.03). A person shall have a marketable record title when the public records disclosed a record title transaction affecting the title to the land which has been of record for not less than 30 years purporting to create such estate either in:

(1)âThe person claiming such estate; or

(2)âSome other person from whom, by one or more title transactions, such estate has passed to the person claiming such estate, with nothing appearing of record, in either case, purporting to divest such claimant of the estate claimed.

STATEMENT OF MARKETABLE TITLE ACTION

The Â Â (name of property ownersâ association)Â Â  (the âAssociationâ) has taken action to ensure that the Â Â (name of declaration, covenant, or restriction)Â Â , recorded in Official Records Book Â , Page Â , of the public records of Â  County, Florida, as may be amended from time to time, currently burdening the property of each and every member of the Association, retains its status with regard to the affected real property. To this end, the Association shall cause the notice required by chapter 712, Florida Statutes, to be recorded in the public records of Â  County, Florida. Copies of this notice and its attachments are available through the Association pursuant to the Associationâs governing documents regarding official records of the Association.

(c)âA full and complete description of all land affected by such notice, which description shall be set forth in particular terms and not by general reference, but if said claim is founded upon a recorded instrument or a covenant or a restriction, the description in such notice may be the same as that contained in such recorded instrument or covenant or restriction, provided the same shall be sufficient to identify the property.

(d)âA statement of the claim showing the nature, description, and extent of such claim or other right subject to extinguishment under this chapter or, in the case of a covenant or restriction, a copy of the covenant or restriction or a reference to the book and page or instrument number in which the same is recorded, except that it is not necessary to show the amount of any claim for money or the terms of payment.

(e)âIf such claim or other right subject to extinguishment under this chapter is based upon an instrument of record or a recorded covenant or restriction, such instrument of record or recorded covenant or restriction shall be deemed sufficiently described to identify the same if the notice includes a reference to the book and page in which the same is recorded.

(f)âSuch notice shall be acknowledged in the same manner as deeds are acknowledged for record.

(2)âSuch notice shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court of the county or counties where the land described therein is situated, together with a true copy thereof. The clerk shall enter, record, and index said notice in the same manner that deeds are entered, recorded, and indexed, as though the claimant were the grantee in the deed and the purported owner were the grantor in a deed, and the clerk shall charge the same fees for recording thereof as are charged for recording deeds. In those counties where the circuit court clerk maintains a tract index, such notice shall also be indexed therein.

(3)âThe person providing the notice referred to in s. [712.05](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/712.05), other than a notice for preservation of a community covenant or restriction, shall:

(a)âCause the clerk of the circuit court to mail by registered or certified mail to the purported owner of said property, as stated in such notice, a copy thereof and shall enter on the original, before recording the same, a certificate showing such mailing.

[28.24](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/28.24)(9) and the necessary costs of mailing, in addition to the recording charges as prescribed in s. [28.24](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/28.24)(13). If the notice names purported owners having more than one address, the person filing the same shall furnish a true copy for each of the several addresses stated, and the clerk shall send one such copy to the purported owners named at each respective address. Such certificate shall be sufficient if the same reads substantially as follows:

I hereby certify that I did on this Â , mail by registered (or certified) mail a copy of the foregoing notice to each of the following at the address stated:

Â Â (Clerk of the circuit court)Â Â \
of Â  County, Florida,\
ByÂ Â (Deputy clerk)Â Â 

The clerk of the circuit court is not required to mail to the purported owner of such property any such notice that pertains solely to the preserving of any covenant or restriction or any portion of a covenant or restriction; or

(b)âPublish once a week, for 2 consecutive weeks, the notice referred to in s. [712.05](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/712.05), with the official record book and page number in which such notice was recorded, in a newspaper as defined in chapter 50 in the county in which the property is located.

(1)âAs used in this section, the term âdiscriminatory restrictionâ means a provision in a title transaction recorded in this state which restricts the ownership, occupancy, or use of any real property in this state by any natural person on the basis of a characteristic that has been held, or is held after September 4, 2020, by the United States Supreme Court or the Florida Supreme Court to be protected against discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or under s. 2, Art. I of the State Constitution, including race, color, national origin, religion, gender, or physical disability.

(2)âA discriminatory restriction is not enforceable in this state, and all discriminatory restrictions contained in any title transaction recorded in this state are unlawful, are unenforceable, and are declared null and void. Any discriminatory restriction contained in a previously recorded title transaction is extinguished and severed from the recorded title transaction, and the remainder of the title transaction remains enforceable and effective. The recording of any notice preserving or protecting interests or rights pursuant to s. [712.06](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/712.06) does not reimpose or preserve any discriminatory restriction that is extinguished under this section.

(3)âUpon request of a parcel owner, a discriminatory restriction appearing in a covenant or restriction affecting the parcel may be removed from the covenant or restriction by an amendment approved by a majority vote of the board of directors of the respective property ownersâ association or an ownersâ association in which all owners may voluntarily join, notwithstanding any other requirements for approval of an amendment of the covenant or restriction. Unless the amendment also changes other provisions of the covenant or restriction, the recording of an amendment removing a discriminatory restriction does not constitute a title transaction occurring after the root of title for purposes of s.

(4)âRevived covenants or restrictions that are implemented pursuant to this section do not apply to or affect the rights of the parcel owner which are recognized by any court order or judgment in any action commenced by October 1, 2019, and any such rights so recognized may not be subsequently altered by revived covenants or restrictions implemented under this section without the consent of the affected parcel owner.

(1)âAny direct contract greater than $2,500 between an owner and a contractor, related to improvements to real property consisting of single or multiple family dwellings up to and including four units, must contain the following notice provision printed in no less than 12-point, capitalized, boldfaced type on the front page of the contract or on a separate page, signed by the owner and dated:

ACCORDING TO FLORIDAâS CONSTRUCTION LIEN LAW (SECTIONS [713.001](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.001)-[713.37](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.37), FLORIDA STATUTES), THOSE WHO WORK ON YOUR PROPERTY OR PROVIDE MATERIALS AND SERVICES AND ARE NOT PAID IN FULL HAVE A RIGHT TO ENFORCE THEIR CLAIM FOR PAYMENT AGAINST YOUR PROPERTY. THIS CLAIM IS KNOWN AS A CONSTRUCTION LIEN. IF YOUR CONTRACTOR OR A SUBCONTRACTOR FAILS TO PAY SUBCONTRACTORS, SUB-SUBCONTRACTORS, OR MATERIAL SUPPLIERS, THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE OWED MONEY MAY LOOK TO YOUR PROPERTY FOR PAYMENT, EVEN IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID YOUR CONTRACTOR IN FULL. IF YOU FAIL TO PAY YOUR CONTRACTOR, YOUR CONTRACTOR MAY ALSO HAVE A LIEN ON YOUR PROPERTY. THIS MEANS IF A LIEN IS FILED YOUR PROPERTY COULD BE SOLD AGAINST YOUR WILL TO PAY FOR LABOR, MATERIALS, OR OTHER SERVICES THAT YOUR CONTRACTOR OR A SUBCONTRACTOR MAY HAVE FAILED TO PAY. TO PROTECT YOURSELF, YOU SHOULD STIPULATE IN THIS CONTRACT THAT BEFORE ANY PAYMENT IS MADE, YOUR CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A WRITTEN RELEASE OF LIEN FROM ANY PERSON OR COMPANY THAT HAS PROVIDED TO YOU A âNOTICE TO OWNER.â FLORIDAâS CONSTRUCTION LIEN LAW IS COMPLEX, AND IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU CONSULT AN ATTORNEY.

(2)(a)âIf the contract is written, the notice must be in the contract document. If the contract is oral or implied, the notice must be provided in a document referencing the contract.

(b)âThe failure to provide such written notice does not bar the enforcement of a lien against a person who has not been adversely affected.

(c)âThis section may not be construed to adversely affect the lien and bond rights of lienors who are not in privity with the owner. This section does not apply when the owner is a contractor licensed under chapter 489 or is a person who created parcels or offers parcels for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business.

(4)âPersons who are not in privity with an owner and who perform labor or services or furnish materials constituting a part of an improvement under the direct contract of another person shall have rights to a lien on real property as provided in s. [713.06](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.06).

(5)âAny improvement for which the direct contract price is $2,500 or less shall be exempt from all other provisions of this part except the provisions of s. [713.05](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.05).

(6)âThe owner and contractor may agree that the contractor shall furnish a payment bond as provided in s. [713.23](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.23), and upon receipt of the bond the owner is exempt from the other provisions of this part as to that direct contract, but this does not exempt the owner from the lien of the contractor who furnishes the bond. If the bond is provided, it shall secure all liens subsequently accruing under this part as provided in s. [713.23](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.23).

(7)âNotwithstanding any other provision of this part, no lien shall exist in favor of any contractor, subcontractor, or sub-subcontractor who is unlicensed as provided in s.

[489.128](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/489.128) or s. [489.532](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/489.532), such unenforceability shall not affect the rights of any other persons to enforce contract, lien, or bond remedies and shall not affect the obligations of a surety that has provided a bond on behalf of the unlicensed contractor, subcontractor, or sub-subcontractor. It shall not be a defense to any claim on a bond or indemnity agreement that the principal or indemnitor is unlicensed as provided in s.

(1)âAny lienor who, regardless of privity, performs services or furnishes material to real property for the purpose of making it suitable as the site for the construction of an improvement or improvements shall be entitled to a lien on the real property for any money that is owed to her or him for her or his services or materials furnished in accordance with her or his contract and the direct contract. The total amount of liens allowed under this section shall not exceed the amount of the direct contract under which the lienor furnishes labor, materials, or services. The work of making real property suitable as the site of an improvement shall include but shall not be limited to the grading, leveling, excavating, and filling of land, including the furnishing of fill soil; the grading and paving of streets, curbs, and sidewalks; the construction of ditches and other area drainage facilities; the laying of pipes and conduits for water, gas, electric, sewage, and drainage purposes; and the construction of canals and shall also include the altering, repairing, and redoing of all these things. When the services or materials are placed on land dedicated to public use and are furnished under contract with the owner of the abutting land, the cost of the services and materials, if unpaid, may be the basis for a lien upon the abutting land. When the services or materials are placed upon land under contract with the owner of the land who subsequently dedicates parts of the land to public use, the person furnishing the services or materials placed upon the dedicated land shall be entitled to a lien upon the land abutting the dedicated land for the unpaid cost of the services and materials placed upon the dedicated land, or in the case of improvements that serve or benefit real property that is divided by the improvements, to a lien upon each abutting part for the equitable part of the full amount due and owing.

(4)âThe owner shall make final payment on account of a direct contract only after the contractor complies with s. [713.06](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.06)(3)(d). Any payment not complying with such requirement shall not qualify as a proper payment under this chapter.

713.05âLiens of persons in privity.âA materialman or laborer, either of whom is in privity with the owner, or a contractor who complies with the provisions of this part shall, subject to the limitations thereof, have a lien on the real property improved for any money that is owed to him or her for labor, services, materials, or other items required by, or furnished in accordance with, the direct contract and for unpaid finance charges due under the lienorâs contract. A materialman or laborer, in privity with the owner, or a contractor shall also have a lien on the ownerâs real property for any money that is owed to him or her for labor, services, or materials furnished to improve public property if the improvements to the public property are a condition of the permit to improve the ownerâs real property. No lien under this section shall be acquired until a claim of lien is recorded. A lienor who, as a subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, laborer, or materialman not in privity with the owner, commences to furnish labor, services, or material to an improvement and who thereafter becomes in privity with the owner shall have a lien for any money that is owed to him or her for the labor, services, or materials furnished after he or she becomes in privity with the owner. A lienor may record one claim of lien to cover both his or her work done in privity with the owner and not in privity with the owner. No lienor under this section shall be required to serve a notice to owner as provided in s. [713.06](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.06)(2). A lienor, except a laborer or materialman, who is in privity with the owner and claims a lien under this section shall furnish the contractorâs affidavit required in s. [713.06](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.06)(3)(d). A contractor may claim a lien for any labor, services, or materials furnished by another lienor for which he or she is obligated to pay the lienor, regardless of the right of the lienor to claim a lien; but, if the lienor claims a valid lien, the contractor shall not recover the amount of the lien recovered by the lienor, and the amount of the contractorâs claim of lien may be reduced accordingly by court order.

713.06âLiens of persons not in privity; proper payments.â

(1)âA materialman or laborer, either of whom is not in privity with the owner, or a subcontractor or sub-subcontractor who complies with the provisions of this part and is subject to the limitations thereof, has a lien on the real property improved for any money that is owed to him or her for labor, services, or materials furnished in accordance with his or her contract and with the direct contract and for any unpaid finance charges due under the lienorâs contract. A materialman or laborer, either of whom is not in privity with the owner, or a subcontractor or sub-subcontractor who complies with the provisions of this part and is subject to the limitations thereof, also has a lien on the ownerâs real property for labor, services, or materials furnished to improve public property if the improvement of the public property is furnished in accordance with his or her contract and with the direct contract. The total amount of all liens allowed under this part for furnishing labor, services, or material covered by any certain direct contract must not exceed the amount of the contract price fixed by the direct contract except as provided in subsection (3). No person may have a lien under this section except those lienors specified in it, as their designations are defined in s. [713.01](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.01).

(2)(a)âAll lienors under this section, except laborers, as a prerequisite to perfecting a lien under this chapter and recording a claim of lien, must serve a notice on the owner setting forth the lienorâs name and address, a description sufficient for identification of the real property, and the nature of the services or materials furnished or to be furnished. A sub-subcontractor or a materialman to a subcontractor must serve a copy of the notice on the contractor as a prerequisite to perfecting a lien under this chapter and recording a claim of lien. A materialman to a sub-subcontractor must serve a copy of the notice to owner on the contractor as a prerequisite to perfecting a lien under this chapter and recording a claim of lien. A materialman to a sub-subcontractor shall serve the notice to owner on the subcontractor if the materialman knows the name and address of the subcontractor. The notice must be served before commencing, or not later than 45 days after commencing, to furnish his or her labor, services, or materials, but, in any event, before the date of the ownerâs disbursement of the final payment after the contractor has furnished the affidavit under subparagraph (3)(d)1. The notice must be served regardless of the method of payments by the owner, whether proper or improper, and does not give to the lienor serving the notice any priority over other lienors in the same category; and the failure to serve the notice, or to timely serve it, is a complete defense to enforcement of a lien by any person. The serving of the notice does not dispense with recording the claim of lien. The notice is not a lien, cloud, or encumbrance on the real property nor actual or constructive notice of any of them.

(b)âIf the owner, in his or her notice of commencement, has designated a person in addition to himself or herself to receive a copy of such lienorâs notice, as provided in s. [713.13](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.13)(1)(b), the lienor shall serve a copy of his or her notice on the person so designated. The failure by the lienor to serve such copy, however, does not invalidate an otherwise valid lien.

(c)âThe notice may be in substantially the following form and must include the information and the warning contained in the following form:

WARNING! FLORIDAâS CONSTRUCTION LIEN LAW ALLOWS SOME UNPAID CONTRACTORS, SUBCONTRACTORS, AND MATERIAL SUPPLIERS TO FILE LIENS AGAINST YOUR PROPERTY EVEN IF YOU HAVE MADE PAYMENT IN FULL.

UNDER FLORIDA LAW, YOUR FAILURE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PAID MAY RESULT IN A LIEN AGAINST YOUR PROPERTY AND YOUR PAYING TWICE.

TO AVOID A LIEN AND PAYING TWICE, YOU MUST OBTAIN A WRITTEN RELEASE FROM US EVERY TIME YOU PAY YOUR CONTRACTOR.

NOTICE TO OWNER

To Â Â (Ownerâs name and address)Â Â 

The undersigned hereby informs you that he or she has furnished or is furnishing services or materials as follows:

Â Â (General description of services or materials)Â Â  for the improvement of the real property identified as Â Â (property description)Â Â  under an order given byÂ Â Â .

Florida law prescribes the serving of this notice and restricts your right to make payments under your contract in accordance with Section [713.06](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.06), Florida Statutes.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR\
YOUR PROTECTION

Under Floridaâs laws, those who work on your property or provide materials and are not paid have a right to enforce their claim for payment against your property. This claim is known as a construction lien.

If your contractor fails to pay subcontractors or material suppliers or neglects to make other legally required payments, the people who are owed money may look to your property for payment, EVEN IF YOU HAVE PAID YOUR CONTRACTOR IN FULL.

PROTECT YOURSELF:

âRECOGNIZE that this Notice to Owner may result in a lien against your property unless all those supplying a Notice to Owner have been paid.

âLEARN more about the Construction Lien Law, Chapter 713, Part I, Florida Statutes, and the meaning of this notice by contacting an attorney or the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.

Â Â (Lienorâs Signature)Â Â 

Â Â (Lienorâs Name)Â Â 

Â Â (Lienorâs Address)Â Â 

Copies to: Â Â (Those persons listed in Section [713.06](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.06)(2)(a) and (b), Florida Statutes)Â Â 

The form may be combined with a notice to contractor given under s. [255.05](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/255.05) or s. [713.23](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.23) and, if so, may be entitled âNOTICE TO OWNER/NOTICE TO CONTRACTOR.â

(d)âA notice to an owner served on a lender must be in writing, must be served in accordance with s. [713.18](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.18), and shall be addressed to the persons designated, if any, and to the place and address designated in the notice of commencement. Any lender who, after receiving a notice provided under this subsection, pays a contractor on behalf of the owner for an improvement shall make proper payments as provided in paragraph (3)(c) as to each such notice received by the lender. The failure of a lender to comply with this paragraph renders the lender liable to the owner for all damages sustained by the owner as a result of that failure. This paragraph does not give any person other than an owner a claim or right of action against a lender for the failure of the lender to comply with this paragraph. Further, this paragraph does not prohibit a lender from disbursing construction funds at any time directly to the owner, in which event the lender has no obligation to make proper payments under this paragraph.

(e)âA lienor, in the absence of a recorded notice of commencement, may rely on the information contained in the building permit application to serve the notice prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c).

(f)âIf a lienor has substantially complied with the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), errors or omissions do not prevent the enforcement of a claim against a person who has not been adversely affected by such omission or error. However, a lienor must strictly comply with the time requirements of paragraph (a).

(3)âThe owner may make proper payments on the direct contract as to lienors under this section, in the following manner:

(a)âIf the description of the property in the notice prescribed by s. [713.13](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.13) is incorrect and the error adversely affects any lienor, payments made on the direct contract shall be held improperly paid to that lienor; but this does not apply to clerical errors when the description listed covers the property where the improvements are.

(b)âThe owner may pay to any laborers the whole or any part of the amounts that shall then be due and payable to them respectively for labor or services performed by them and covered by the direct contract, and shall deduct the same from the balance due the contractor under a direct contract.

(c)âWhen any payment becomes due to the contractor on the direct contract, except the final payment:

1.âThe owner shall pay or cause to be paid, within the limitations imposed by subparagraph 2., the sum then due to each lienor giving notice prior to the time of the payment. The owner may require, and, in such event, the contractor shall furnish as a prerequisite to requiring payment to himself or herself, an affidavit as prescribed in subparagraph (d)1., on any payment made, or to be made, on a direct contract, but the furnishing of the affidavit shall not relieve the owner of his or her responsibility to pay or cause to be paid all lienors giving notice. The owner shall be under no obligation to any lienor, except laborers, from whom he or she has not received a notice to owner at the time of making a payment.

2.âWhen the payment due is insufficient to pay all bills of lienors giving notice, the owner shall prorate the amount then due under the direct contract among the lienors giving notice pro rata in the manner prescribed in subsection (4). Lienors receiving money shall execute partial releases, as provided in s. [713.20](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.20)(2), to the extent of the payment received.

3.âIf any affidavit permitted hereunder recites any outstanding bills for labor, services, or materials, the owner may pay the bills in full direct to the person or firm to which they are due if the balance due on the direct contract at the time the affidavit is given is sufficient to pay the bills and shall deduct the amounts so paid from the balance of payment due the contractor. This subparagraph shall not create any obligation of the owner to pay any person who is not a lienor giving notice.

4.âNo person furnishing labor or material, or both, who is required to serve a notice under paragraph (2)(a) and who did not serve the notice and whose time for service has expired shall be entitled to be paid by the owner because he or she is listed in an affidavit furnished by the contractor under subparagraph (c)1.

5.âIf the contract is terminated before completion, the contractor shall comply with subparagraph (d)1.

(d)âWhen the final payment under a direct contract becomes due the contractor:

1.âThe contractor shall give to the owner a final payment affidavit stating, if that be the fact, that all lienors under his or her direct contract who have timely served a notice to owner on the owner and the contractor have been paid in full or, if the fact be otherwise, showing the name of each such lienor who has not been paid in full and the amount due or to become due each for labor, services, or materials furnished. The affidavit must be in substantially the following form:

CONTRACTORâS FINAL PAYMENT AFFIDAVIT

State of Florida\
County of Â 

Before me, the undersigned authority, personally appeared Â Â (name of affiant)Â Â , who, after being first duly sworn, deposes and says of his or her personal knowledge the following:

1.âHe or she is the Â Â (title of affiant)Â Â , of Â Â (name of contractorâs business)Â Â , which does business in the State of Florida, hereinafter referred to as the âContractor.â

2.âContractor, pursuant to a contract with Â Â (name of owner)Â Â , hereinafter referred to as the âOwner,â has furnished or caused to be furnished labor, materials, and services for the construction of certain improvements to real property as more particularly set forth in said contract.

3.âThis affidavit is executed by the Contractor in accordance with section [713.06](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.06) of the Florida Statutes for the purposes of obtaining final payment from the Owner in the amount of $Â .

4.âAll work to be performed under the contract has been fully completed, and all lienors under the direct contract have been paid in full, except the following listed lienors:

NAME OF LIENORÂ Â Â Â AMOUNT DUE

Signed, sealed, and delivered this Â  day of Â , Â ,

By Â Â (name of affiant)Â Â 

Â Â (title of affiant)Â Â 

Â Â (name of contractorâs business)Â Â 

Sworn to and subscribed before me this Â  day of Â  by Â Â (name of affiant)Â Â , who is personally known to me or produced Â  as identification, and did take an oath.

Â Â (name of notary public)Â Â 

Notary Public

My Commission Expires:

Â Â (date of expiration of commission)Â Â 

The contractor shall have no lien or right of action against the owner for labor, services, or materials furnished under the direct contract while in default for not giving the owner the affidavit; however, the negligent inclusion or omission of any information in the affidavit which has not prejudiced the owner does not constitute a default that operates to defeat an otherwise valid lien. The contractor shall execute the affidavit and deliver it to the owner at least 5 days before instituting an action as a prerequisite to the institution of any action to enforce his or her lien under this chapter, even if the final payment has not become due because the contract is terminated for a reason other than completion and regardless of whether the contractor has any lienors working under him or her or not.

2.âIf the contractorâs affidavit required in this subsection recites any outstanding bills for labor, services, or materials, the owner may, after giving the contractor at least 10 daysâ written notice, pay such bills in full direct to the person or firm to which they are due, if the balance due on a direct contract at the time the affidavit is given is sufficient to pay them and lienors giving notice, and shall deduct the amounts so paid from the balance due the contractor. Lienors listed in said affidavit not giving notice, whose 45-day notice time has not expired, shall be paid in full or pro rata, as appropriate, from any balance then remaining due the contractor; but no lienor whose notice time has expired shall be paid by the owner or by any other person except the person with whom that lienor has a contract.

3.âIf the balance due is not sufficient to pay in full all lienors listed in the affidavit and entitled to payment from the owner under this part and other lienors giving notice, the owner shall pay no money to anyone until such time as the contractor has furnished him or her with the difference; however, if the contractor fails to furnish the difference within 10 days from delivery of the affidavit or notice from the owner to the contractor to furnish the affidavit, the owner shall determine the amount due each lienor and shall disburse to them the amounts due from him or her on a direct contract in accordance with the procedure established by subsection (4).

4.âThe owner shall have the right to rely on the contractorâs affidavit given under this paragraph in making the final payment, unless there are lienors giving notice who are not listed in the affidavit. If there are lienors giving notice who are not so listed, the owner may pay such lienors and any persons listed in the affidavit that are entitled to be paid by the owner under subparagraph 2. and shall thereupon be discharged of any further responsibility under the direct contract, except for any balance that may be due to the contractor.

5.âThe owner shall retain the final payment due under the direct contract that shall not be disbursed until the contractorâs affidavit under subparagraph 1. has been furnished to the owner.

6.âWhen final payment has become due to the contractor and the owner fails to withhold as required by subparagraph 5., the property improved shall be subject to the full amount of all valid liens of which the owner has notice at the time the contractor furnishes his or her affidavit.

(e)âIf the improvement is abandoned before completion, the owner shall determine the amount due each lienor giving notice and shall pay the same in full or prorate in the same manner as provided in subsection (4).

(f)âNo contractor shall have any right to require the owner to pay any money to him or her under a direct contract if such money cannot be properly paid by the owner to the contractor in accordance with this section.

(g)âExcept with written consent of the contractor, before paying any money directly to any lienor except the contractor or any laborer, the owner shall give the contractor at least 10 daysâ written notice of his or her intention to do so, and the amount he or she proposes to pay each lienor.

(h)âWhen the owner has properly retained all sums required in this section to be retained but has otherwise made improper payments, the ownerâs real property shall be liable to all laborers, subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, and materialmen complying with this chapter only to the extent of the retentions and the improper payments, notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection. Any money paid by the owner on a direct contract, the payment of which is proved to have caused no detriment to any certain lienor, shall be held properly paid as to the lienor, and if any of the money shall be held not properly paid as to any other lienors, the entire benefit of its being held not properly paid as to them shall go to the lienors.

(4)(a)âIn determining the amounts for which liens between lienors claiming under a direct contract shall be paid by the owner or allowed by the court within the total amount fixed by the direct contract and under the provisions of this section, the owner or court shall pay or allow such liens in the following order:

1.âLiens of all laborers.

2.âLiens of all persons other than the contractor.

3.âLien of the contractor.

(b)âShould the total amount for which liens under such direct contract may be allowed be less than the total amount of liens under such contract in all classes above mentioned, all liens in a class shall be allowed for their full amounts before any liens shall be allowed to any subsequent class. Should the amount applicable to the liens of any single class be insufficient to permit all liens within that class to be allowed for their full amounts, each lien shall be allowed for its pro rata share of the total amount applicable to liens of that class; but if the same labor, services, or materials shall be covered by liens of more than one class, such labor, services, or materials shall be allowed only in the earliest class by which they shall be covered; and also if the same labor, services, or materials shall be covered by liens of two or more lienors of the same class, such labor, services, or materials shall be allowed only in the lien of the lienor farthest removed from the contractor. This section shall not be construed to affect the priority of liens derived under separate direct contracts.

SECTION 11\
Liens for improving land in which the contracting party has no interest.

713.11âLiens for improving land in which the contracting party has no interest.âWhen the person contracting for improving real property has no interest as owner in the land, no lien shall attach to the land, except as provided in s. [713.12](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.12), but if removal of such improvement from the land is practicable, the lien of a lienor shall attach to the improvement on which he or she has performed labor or services or for which he or she has furnished materials. The court, in the enforcement of such lien, may order such improvement to be separately sold and the purchaser may remove it within such reasonable time as the court may fix. The purchase price for such improvement shall be paid into court. The owner of the land upon which the improvement was made may demand that the land be restored substantially to its condition before the improvement was commenced, in which case the court shall order its restoration and the reasonable charge therefor shall be first paid out of such purchase price and the remainder shall be paid to lienors and other encumbrancers in accordance with their respective rights.

713.135âNotice of commencement and applicability of lien.â

(1)âWhen a person applies for a building permit, the authority issuing such permit shall:

(a)âPrint on the face of each permit card in no less than 14-point, capitalized, boldfaced type: âWARNING TO OWNER: YOUR FAILURE TO RECORD A NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT MAY RESULT IN YOUR PAYING TWICE FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO YOUR PROPERTY. A NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT MUST BE RECORDED AND POSTED ON THE SITE OF THE IMPROVEMENT BEFORE THE FIRST INSPECTION. IF YOU INTEND TO OBTAIN FINANCING, CONSULT WITH YOUR LENDER OR AN ATTORNEY BEFORE RECORDING YOUR NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT.â

(b)âProvide the applicant and the owner of the real property upon which improvements are to be constructed with a printed statement stating that the right, title, and interest of the person who has contracted for the improvement may be subject to attachment under the Construction Lien Law. The Department of Business and Professional Regulation shall furnish, for distribution, the statement described in this paragraph, and the statement must be a summary of the Construction Lien Law and must include an explanation of the provisions of the Construction Lien Law relating to the recording, and the posting of copies, of notices of commencement and a statement encouraging the owner to record a notice of commencement and post a copy of the notice of commencement in accordance with s. [713.13](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.13). The statement must also contain an explanation of the ownerâs rights if a lienor fails to furnish the owner with a notice as provided in s. [713.06](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.06)(2) and an explanation of the ownerâs rights as provided in s. [713.22](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.22). The authority that issues the building permit must obtain from the Department of Business and Professional Regulation the statement required by this paragraph and must mail, deliver by electronic mail or other electronic format or facsimile, or personally deliver that statement to the owner or, in a case in which the owner is required to personally appear to obtain the permit, provide that statement to any owner making improvements to real property consisting of a single or multiple family dwelling up to and including four units. However, the failure by the authorities to provide the summary does not subject the issuing authority to liability.

(c)âIn addition to providing the owner with the statement as required by paragraph (b), inform each applicant who is not the person whose right, title, and interest is subject to attachment that, as a condition to the issuance of a building permit, the applicant must promise in good faith that the statement will be delivered to the person whose property is subject to attachment.

(d)âFurnish to the applicant two or more copies of a form of notice of commencement conforming with s. [713.13](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.13).

(e)âRequire the applicant to file with the issuing authority before the first inspection a copy of the notice of commencement if the direct contract is greater than $5,000. For purposes of this paragraph, the term âcopy of the notice of commencementâ means a certified copy of the recorded notice of commencement, a notarized statement that the notice of commencement has been filed for recording along with a copy thereof, or the clerkâs officeâs official records identifying information that includes the instrument number for the notice of commencement or the number and page of book where the notice of commencement is recorded, as identified by the clerk.

1.âIn the absence of the filing of a copy of the notice of commencement, the issuing authority or a private provider performing inspection services may not perform or approve subsequent inspections until the applicant files by mail, facsimile, hand delivery, or any other means such copy with the issuing authority.

2.âThe copy of the notice of commencement must contain the name and address of the owner, the name and address of the contractor, and the location or address of the property being improved. The issuing authority shall verify that the name and address of the owner, the name of the contractor, and the location or address of the property being improved which is contained in the copy of the notice of commencement is consistent with the information in the building permit application.

3.âThe issuing authority shall provide the recording information on the copy of the notice of commencement to any person upon request.

4.âThis paragraph does not require the recording of a notice of commencement before the issuance of a building permit. If a local government requires a separate permit or inspection for installation of temporary electrical service or other temporary utility service, land clearing, or other preliminary site work, such permits may be issued and such inspections may be conducted without providing the issuing authority with a copy of the notice of commencement.

(f)âNot require that a notice of commencement be recorded as a condition of the application for, or processing or issuance of, a building permit. However, this paragraph does not modify or waive the inspection requirements set forth in this subsection.

This subsection does not apply to a direct contract to repair or replace an existing heating or air-conditioning system in an amount less than $15,000.

(2)âAn issuing authority under subsection (1) is not liable in any civil action for the failure of the person whose property is subject to attachment to receive or to be delivered a printed statement stating that the right, title, and interest of the person who has contracted for the improvement may be subject to attachment under the Construction Lien Law.

(3)âAn issuing authority under subsection (1) is not liable in any civil action for the failure to verify that a certified copy of the recorded notice of commencement, a notarized statement that the notice of commencement has been filed for recording along with a copy thereof, or the clerkâs officeâs official records identifying information that includes the instrument number for the notice of commencement or the number and page of book where the notice of commencement is recorded, as identified by the clerk, has been filed in accordance with this section.

(4)âThe several boards of county commissioners, municipal councils, or other similar bodies may by ordinance or resolution establish reasonable fees for furnishing copies of the forms and the printed statement provided in paragraphs (1)(b) and (d) in an amount not to exceed $5 to be paid by the applicant for each permit in addition to all other costs of the permit; however, no forms or statement need be furnished, mailed, or otherwise provided to, nor may such additional fee be obtained from, applicants for permits in those cases in which the owner of a legal or equitable interest (including that of ownership of stock of a corporate landowner) of the real property to be improved is engaged in the business of construction of buildings for sale to others and intends to make the improvements authorized by the permit on the property and upon completion will offer the improved real property for sale.

(5)âIn addition to any other information required by the authority issuing the permit, each building permit application must contain:

(a)âThe name and address of the owner of the real property;

(b)âThe name and address of the contractor;

(c)âA description sufficient to identify the real property to be improved; and

(d)âThe number or identifying symbol assigned to the building permit by the issuing authority, which number or symbol must be affixed to the application by the issuing authority.

(6)âAn authority that issues building permits may not require an applicant to provide a direct contract or a contract between a contractor and any other lienor as a condition of the application for, or processing or issuance of, a building permit for the construction of improvements or for the alteration or repair of improvements on or to commercial property. This subsection does not apply to the construction of improvements or the alteration or repair of improvements owned or leased by the federal government, the state or any county, city, or political subdivision thereof, or other public authority.

(7)(a)âIn addition to any other information required by the authority issuing the permit, the building permit application must be in substantially the following form:

(1)âAny owner, contractor, subcontractor, or sub-subcontractor, in making any payment under, or properly applicable to, any contract to one with whom she or he has a running account, or with whom she or he has more than one contract, or to whom she or he is otherwise indebted, shall designate the contract under which the payment is made or the items of account to which it is to be applied. If she or he shall fail to do so or shall make a false designation, she or he shall be liable to anyone suffering a loss in consequence for the amount of the loss.

(2)âWhen a payment for materials is made to a subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, or materialman, the subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, or materialman shall demand of the person making the payment a designation of the account and the items of account to which the payment is to apply. In any case in which a lien is claimed for materials furnished by a subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, or materialman, it is a defense to the claim, to the extent of the payment made, to prove that a payment made by the owner to the contractor for the materials has been paid over to the subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, or materialman, and to prove also that when such payment was received by such subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, or materialman she or he did not demand a designation of the account and of the items of account to which the payment was to be applied or, receiving a designation of its application to the account for the materials, she or he failed to apply the payment in accordance therewith. This subsection is cumulative to any other defenses available to the person paying the materialman, subcontractor, or sub-subcontractor.

(g)âContain the motor vehicle repair shopâs registration number, ownerâs name, and physical address and the entity name, as registered with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, of the business where the repair work or storage occurred, which must also appear on the outside of the envelope sent to the registered owner, the customer, and all other persons claiming an interest in or lien on the vehicle.

(j)âContain notice that the lien claimed by the lienor is subject to enforcement pursuant to this section and that the vehicle may be sold to satisfy the lien.

(m)âContain notice that the owner of the vehicle has a right to recover possession of the vehicle without instituting judicial proceedings by posting bond in accordance with s. [559.917](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/559.917).

(n)âContain notice that any proceeds from the sale of the vehicle remaining after payment of the amount claimed to be due and owing to the lienor will be deposited with the clerk of the circuit court for disposition upon court order pursuant to subsection (8).

(o)âContain notice that a lienholder, if any, has the right, as specified in subsection (5), to demand a hearing or to post a bond.

(p)âContain a statement that the lienor will make the vehicle available for inspection during regular business hours within 3 business days after receiving a written request to inspect the vehicle from a notice recipient, who may present either a copy of an electronic title or a paper title as evidence of his or her interest in and right to inspect the vehicle.

(q)âContain the address at which the vehicle is physically located.

(2)âIf attempts to locate the owner or lienholder are unsuccessful after a check of the records of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles and any state disclosed by the check of the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System or an equivalent commercially available system, the lienor must notify the local law enforcement agency in writing by certified mail or acknowledged hand delivery that the lienor has been unable to locate the owner or lienholder, that a physical search of the vehicle has disclosed no ownership information, and that a good faith effort, including records checks of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles database and the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System or an equivalent commercially available system, has been made. A description of the motor vehicle which includes the year, make, and identification number must be given on the notice. This notification must take place within 7 business days, excluding Saturday and Sunday, after the date on which storage charges begin to accrue on the vehicle. For purposes of this subsection, the term âgood faith effortâ means that the following checks have been performed by the company to establish the prior state of registration and title:

(a)âA check of the departmentâs database for the owner and any lienholder.

(b)âA check of the federally mandated electronic National Motor Vehicle Title Information System or an equivalent commercially available system to determine the state of registration when there is not a current title or registration record for the vehicle on file with the department.

(3)âA vehicle may not be sold earlier than 60 days after completion of the repair work. If the date of the sale was not included in the notice of lien required in subsection (1), notice of the sale must be sent by certified mail at least 15 days before the date of sale to the customer as indicated on the order for repair and to all other persons claiming an interest in or lien on the motor vehicle, as disclosed by the records of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or of a corresponding agency of any other state in which the vehicle appears to have been registered after completion of a check of the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System or an equivalent commercially available system. Such notice must:

(a)âBe sent by certified mail with the last 8 digits of the vehicle identification number of the motor vehicle subject to the sale clearly identified and printed in the delivery address box and on the outside of the envelope sent to the registered owner, the customer, and all other persons claiming an interest therein or lien thereon.

(b)âContain the motor vehicle repair shopâs registration number, ownerâs name, and physical address and the entity name, as registered with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, of the business where the repair work or storage occurred, which must also appear on the outside of the envelope containing the notice of sale in the return address section of the envelope.

(4)âThe lienor, at least 15 days before the proposed or scheduled date of sale of the vehicle, shall publish the notice required by this section once in a newspaper circulated in the county where the vehicle repair work was completed and where the sale is to take place. A certificate of compliance with the notification provisions of this section, which includes the vehicle identification number, verified by the lienor, together with a copy of the notice of lien required by subsection (1) and the notice of sale required by subsection (3), which must include proof of publication, and checks of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles and the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System or an equivalent commercially available system, must be duly and expeditiously filed with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the vehicle is held. The lienor, at the time of filing the certificate of compliance, must pay to the clerk of that court a service charge of $10 for indexing and recording the certificate.

(5)âAt any time before the proposed or scheduled date of sale of a vehicle, the owner of the vehicle, or any person claiming an interest in the vehicle or a lien thereon, may post a bond following the procedures outlined in s. [559.917](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/559.917) or file a demand for hearing with the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which the vehicle is held to determine whether the vehicle has been wrongfully taken or withheld from her or him. A lienholder has standing to allege any violation of part IX of chapter 559 in a proceeding instituted pursuant to this subsection. Any person who files a demand for hearing shall mail copies of the demand to all other owners and lienors as reflected on the notice required in subsection (1).

(a)âUpon the filing of a demand for hearing, a hearing shall be held before the proposed or scheduled date of sale of the vehicle.

(b)âUpon the posting of the bond and payment of the applicable fee set forth in s. [28.24](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/28.24), the clerk of the court shall issue a certificate notifying the lienor of the posting of the bond and directing the lienor to release the vehicle to the lienholder or the owner, based upon whomever posted the bond.

(c)âIf a lienholder obtains the vehicle and the owner of the vehicle is not in default under the installment sales contract or title loan at the time the lienholder has possession of the vehicle, the lienholder must return the vehicle to the owner within 5 days after the owner repays the lienholder for the amount of the bond, or makes arrangements to repay the lienholder for the bond under terms agreeable to the lienholder. A lienholder may retain possession of the vehicle if the owner is in default until such time as the default is cured and the amount of the bond is repaid by the owner, or an arrangement agreeable to the lienholder is made with the owner.

(6)âIn the event a lienor institutes a judicial proceeding to enforce a lien, no filing fee shall be required at the time of filing, but the court shall require the lienor to pay the filing fee unless the lienor shall prevail in the action.

(7)âAt a hearing on a complaint relating to the requirements of this section, the court shall issue an order determining:

(a)âWhether the vehicle is subject to a valid lien by the lienor and the amount thereof;

(b)âThe priority of the lien of the lienor as against any existing security interest in the vehicle;

(c)âThe distribution of any proceeds of the sale by the clerk of the circuit court;

(d)âThe awarding of damages, if any;

(e)âThe award of reasonable attorney fees and costs, at the courtâs discretion, to the prevailing party; and

(f)âThe reasonableness of storage charges.

A final order, by the court, must also provide for immediate payment of any proceeds or awards, and the immediate release of the bond to the posting party, if applicable.

(8)âA vehicle subject to lien enforcement pursuant to this section must be sold by the lienor at public sale. Immediately upon the sale of the vehicle and payment in cash of the purchase price, the lienor shall deposit with the clerk of the circuit court the proceeds of the sale less the amount claimed by the lienor for work done and storage, if any, and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in conducting the sale, including any attorneyâs fees and costs ordered by the court. Simultaneously with depositing the proceeds of sale remaining after payment to the lienor, the lienor shall file with the clerk a verified report of the sale stating a description of the vehicle sold, including the vehicle identification number; the name and address of the purchaser; the date of the sale; and the selling price. The report shall also itemize the amount retained by the lienor pursuant to this section and shall indicate whether a hearing was demanded and held. All proceeds held by the court shall be held for the benefit of the owner of the vehicle or any lienholder whose lien is discharged by the sale and shall be disbursed only upon order of the court. Unless a proceeding is initiated to validate a claim to such proceeds within 1 year and a day from the date of the sale, the proceeds shall be deemed abandoned property and disposition thereof shall be governed by s. [705.103](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/705.103). The clerk shall receive 5 percent of the proceeds deposited with her or him, not to exceed $25, for her or his services under this section.

(9)(a)âA copy of the certificate of compliance, which must include the vehicle identification number, and the report of sale, certified by the clerk of the court, a copy of the notice of lien required by subsection (1) and the notice of sale required by subsection (3), and proof of the required check of the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System or an equivalent commercially available system shall constitute satisfactory proof for application to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles for transfer of title, together with any other proof required by any rules and regulations of the department.

(b)âThe Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles may not approve an application for transfer of title if the application fails to include a copy of the notice of lien required by subsection (1) and the notice of sale required by subsection (3). The vehicle identification number on the notice of lien must match the vehicle identification number of the vehicle that is the subject of the transfer of title.

(10)âNothing contained in this section shall be construed as affecting an ownerâs right to redeem her or his vehicle from the lien at any time prior to sale by paying the amount claimed by the lienor for work done and assessed storage charges, plus any costs incurred by the repair shop for utilizing enforcement procedures under this section.

(11)âNothing in this section shall operate in derogation of the rights and remedies established by s. [559.917](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/559.917).

(12)âWhen a vehicle is sold by a lienor in accordance with this law, a purchaser for value takes title to the vehicle free and clear of all claims, liens, and encumbrances whatsoever, unless otherwise provided by court order.

(13)âA failure to make good faith efforts as defined in subsection (2) precludes the imposition of any storage charges against the vehicle. If a lienor fails to provide notice to any person claiming a lien on a vehicle under subsection (1) within 7 business days after the date of storage of the vehicle, the lienor may not charge the person for more than 7 days of storage, but such failure does not affect charges made for repairs, adjustments, or modifications to the vehicle or the priority of liens on the vehicle.

(14)âAt any time before the proposed or scheduled date of sale of a vehicle, the owner, the customer, or a person claiming an interest therein or lien thereon may request to inspect the vehicle. The lienor must make the vehicle available for inspection during regular business hours within 3 business days after receiving a written request to inspect the vehicle.

(15)(a)âA lienor or the lienorâs agent may charge an administrative fee to the registered owner or a person of record claiming a lien against the vehicle to obtain release of the vehicle from the claim of lien imposed under this section. Such administrative fee may not exceed $250. For purposes of this paragraph, the term âadministrative feeâ means a lien fee or any fee imposed by the lienor or the lienorâs agent for administrative costs added to the amount due for storage, repairs, adjustments, or modifications to the vehicle.

(b)âA lienor or the lienorâs agent may not charge fees or costs, other than those authorized in this section, that exceed $250.

(16)âA motor vehicle repair shop, garage, automotive service facility, or storage operator must use a third-party service approved by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to transmit all notices required by this section. If there is no third-party service approved by the department, the motor vehicle repair shop, garage, automotive service facility, or storage operator may mail the notices and provide evidence of compliance with this section upon submission of an application for certificate of title or certificate of destruction.

(a)âFor purposes of this subsection, the term âthird-party serviceâ means a qualified business entity that, upon a request submitted through a website by a motor vehicle repair shop, garage, automotive service facility, or storage operator:

1.âAccesses the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System records to obtain the last state of record of the vehicle.

2.âAccesses the owner, lienholder, and insurer information, as applicable, for a vehicle from the department.

3.âElectronically generates the notices required of a motor vehicle repair shop, an automotive service facility, a garage, and a towing-storage operator by this section through the website.

4.âPrints and sends the notices required under this section to each owner, lienholder, and insurer of record by certified mail.

5.âElectronically returns tracking information or other proof of mailing and delivery of the notices to the motor vehicle repair shop, automotive service facility, garage, and towing-storage operator.

6.âElectronically reports to the department, via an electronic data exchange process using a web interface, the following information related to the repair and storage notices:

a.âThe vehicle identification number.

b.âThe license plate number.

c.âThe name and address of the repair shop or lienor.

d.âThe physical location of the vehicle.

e.âThe date on which the vehicle was dropped off for repairs.

f.âThe date on which the repairs were completed.

g.âThe amount due for repairs and the storage amount per day.

h.âThe dates on which the notice was mailed and delivered.

i.âThe date on which the owner was notified that the repairs were completed.

j.âOther information required by the department.

(b)âA third-party service must apply to and be approved by the department in order to provide notices under this section. The department shall prescribe the format for the application. The department may approve the applicant as qualified to perform the services provided in paragraph (a) if the applicant:

1.âProvides the department with a $1 million bond.

2.âSubmits an acceptable internal control and data security audit (Level 2) or its equivalent performed by a licensed certified public accountant.

3.âSuccessfully demonstrates the ability to electronically provide required data to the department via an electronic data exchange process using a web interface.

(c)âThe department may deny, suspend, or revoke approval of a third-party service if the department determines that the third-party service has committed an act of fraud or misrepresentation related to a notice required by this section.

(d)âA third-party service must maintain all records related to providing notices under this section for 5 years and allow the department to inspect and copy such records upon request. The records may be maintained in an electronic format.

(e)âA third-party service must annually provide the department with evidence that it maintains a $1 million bond and must annually submit an internal control and data security audit (Level 2) or its equivalent performed by a licensed certified public accountant to continue its approved status each year.

(f)âA third-party service must maintain a publicly available website that allows owners, registrants, lienholders, insurance companies, or their agents to search for notices sent pursuant to this section. The search results must exclude personal identifying information but provide the same information provided to the department.

(17)âA lienor must release to the owner, lienholder, or agent thereof all of the personal property found in but not affixed to the vehicle. Upon payment of the charges owed, the lienor must release the vehicle to the paying owner, lienholder, or agent thereof.

(18)âA lienor must accept either a copy of an electronic title or a paper title as evidence of a personâs interest in a vehicle.

she or he shall have a lien on the vehicle or vessel for a reasonable towing fee, for a reasonable administrative fee or charge imposed by a county or municipality, and for a reasonable storage fee; except that a storage fee may not be charged if the vehicle or vessel is stored for fewer than 6 hours.

(3)âThis section does not authorize any person to claim a lien on a vehicle for fees or charges connected with the immobilization of such vehicle using a vehicle boot or other similar device pursuant to s. [715.07](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/715.07).

(4)(a)âA person regularly engaged in the business of recovering, towing, or storing vehicles or vessels who comes into possession of a vehicle or vessel pursuant to subsection (2), and who claims a lien for recovery, towing, or storage services, shall give notice, by certified mail, to the registered owner, the insurance company insuring the vehicle notwithstanding s. [627.736](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/627.736), and all persons claiming a lien thereon, as disclosed by the records in the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or as disclosed by the records of any corresponding agency in any other state in which the vehicle is identified through a records check of the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System or an equivalent commercially available system as being titled or registered.

(b)âWhenever a law enforcement agency authorizes the removal of a vehicle or vessel or whenever a towing service, garage, repair shop, or automotive service, storage, or parking place notifies the law enforcement agency of possession of a vehicle or vessel pursuant to s. [715.07](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/715.07)(2)(a)2., the law enforcement agency of the jurisdiction where the vehicle or vessel is stored shall contact the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, or the appropriate agency of the state of registration, if known, within 24 hours through the medium of electronic communications, giving the full description of the vehicle or vessel. Upon receipt of the full description of the vehicle or vessel, the department shall search its files to determine the ownerâs name, the insurance company insuring the vehicle or vessel, and whether any person has filed a lien upon the vehicle or vessel as provided in s. [319.27](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/319.27)(2) and (3) and notify the applicable law enforcement agency within 72 hours. The person in charge of the towing service, garage, repair shop, or automotive service, storage, or parking place shall obtain such information from the applicable law enforcement agency within 5 days after the date of storage and shall give notice pursuant to paragraph (a). The department may release the insurance company information to the requestor notwithstanding s. [627.736](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/627.736).

(c)âThe notice of lien must be sent by certified mail to the registered owner, the insurance company insuring the vehicle notwithstanding s. [627.736](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/627.736), and all other persons claiming a lien thereon within 7 business days, excluding Saturday and Sunday, after the date of storage of the vehicle or vessel. However, in no event shall the notice of lien be sent less than 30 days before the sale of the vehicle or vessel. The notice must state:

1.âIf the claim of lien is for a vehicle, the last 8 digits of the vehicle identification number of the vehicle subject to the lien, or, if the claim of lien is for a vessel, the hull identification number of the vessel subject to the lien, clearly printed in the delivery address box and on the outside of the envelope sent to the registered owner and all other persons claiming an interest therein or lien thereon.

7.âThat the lien is subject to enforcement under law and that the owner or lienholder, if any, has the right to a hearing as set forth in subsection (5).

8.âThat any vehicle or vessel that remains unclaimed, or for which the charges for recovery, towing, or storage services remain unpaid, may be sold free of all prior liens 35 days after the vehicle or vessel is stored by the lienor if the vehicle or vessel is more than 3 years of age or 50 days after the vehicle or vessel is stored by the lienor if the vehicle or vessel is 3 years of age or less.

9.âThe address at which the vehicle or vessel is physically located.

(d)âThe notice of lien may not be sent to the registered owner, the insurance company insuring the vehicle or vessel, and all other persons claiming a lien thereon less than 30 days before the sale of the vehicle or vessel.

(e)âIf attempts to locate the name and address of the owner or lienholder prove unsuccessful, the towing-storage operator shall, after 7 business days, excluding Saturday and Sunday, after the initial tow or storage, notify the public agency of jurisdiction where the vehicle or vessel is stored in writing by certified mail or acknowledged hand delivery that the towing-storage company has been unable to locate the name and address of the owner or lienholder and a physical search of the vehicle or vessel has disclosed no ownership information and a good faith effort has been made, including records checks of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles database and the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System or an equivalent commercially available system. For purposes of this paragraph and subsection (9), the term âgood faith effortâ means that the following checks have been performed by the company to establish the prior state of registration and for title:

1.âA check of the departmentâs database for the owner and any lienholder.

2.âA check of the electronic National Motor Vehicle Title Information System or an equivalent commercially available system to determine the state of registration when there is not a current registration record for the vehicle or vessel on file with the department.

5.âA check of the trip sheet or tow ticket of the tow truck operator to determine whether a tag was on the vehicle or vessel at the beginning of the tow, if a private tow.

6.âIf there is no address of the owner on the impound report, a check of the law enforcement report to determine whether an out-of-state address is indicated from driver license information.

7.âA check of the vehicle or vessel for an inspection sticker or other stickers and decals that may indicate a state of possible registration.

8.âA check of the interior of the vehicle or vessel for any papers that may be in the glove box, trunk, or other areas for a state of registration.

9.âA check of the vehicle for a vehicle identification number.

10.âA check of the vessel for a vessel registration number.

11.âA check of the vessel hull for a hull identification number which should be carved, burned, stamped, embossed, or otherwise permanently affixed to the outboard side of the transom or, if there is no transom, to the outmost seaboard side at the end of the hull that bears the rudder or other steering mechanism.

(5)(a)âThe owner of a vehicle or vessel removed pursuant to subsection (2), or any person claiming a lien, other than the towing-storage operator, within 10 days after the time she or he has knowledge of the location of the vehicle or vessel, may file a complaint in the county court of the county in which the vehicle or vessel is stored to determine whether her or his property was wrongfully taken or withheld.

(b)âAt any time before the sale of the vehicle or vessel, an owner or lienholder may have her or his vehicle or vessel released upon posting with the court a cash or surety bond or other adequate security equal to the amount of the charges for towing or storage and lot rental amount to ensure the payment of such charges in the event she or he does not prevail. Upon the posting of the bond and the payment of the applicable fee set forth in s. [28.24](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/28.24), the clerk of the court shall issue a certificate notifying the lienor of the posting of the bond and directing the lienor to release the vehicle or vessel. At the time of such release, after reasonable inspection, she or he shall give a receipt to the towing-storage company reciting any claims she or he has for loss or damage to the vehicle or vessel or the contents thereof.

(c)âUpon determining the respective rights of the parties, the court may award damages, attorneyâs fees, and costs in favor of the prevailing party. In any event, the final order shall provide for immediate payment in full of recovery, towing, and storage fees by the vehicle or vessel owner or lienholder; or the agency ordering the tow; or the owner, lessee, or agent thereof of the property from which the vehicle or vessel was removed.

(6)âA vehicle or vessel that is stored pursuant to subsection (2) and remains unclaimed, or for which reasonable charges for recovery, towing, or storing remain unpaid, and any contents not released pursuant to subsection (10), may be sold by the owner or operator of the storage space for such towing or storage charge 35 days after the vehicle or vessel is stored by the lienor if the vehicle or vessel is more than 3 years of age or 50 days after the vehicle or vessel is stored by the lienor if the vehicle or vessel is 3 years of age or less. The sale shall be at public sale for cash. If the date of the sale was not included in the notice required in subsection (4), notice of the sale shall be given to the person in whose name the vehicle or vessel is registered and to all persons claiming a lien on the vehicle or vessel as shown on the records of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or of any corresponding agency in any other state in which the vehicle is identified through a records check of the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System or an equivalent commercially available system as being titled. Notice of the sale must be sent by certified mail. The notice must have clearly identified and printed, if the claim of lien is for a motor vehicle, the last 8 digits of the vehicle identification number of the motor vehicle subject to the lien, or, if the claim of lien is for a vessel, the hull identification number of the vessel subject to the lien, in the delivery address box and on the outside of the envelope sent to the registered owner and all other persons claiming an interest therein or lien thereon. The notice must be sent to the owner of the vehicle or vessel and the person having the recorded lien on the vehicle or vessel at the address shown on the records of the registering agency at least 30 days before the sale of the vehicle or vessel. The notice must state the name, physical address, and telephone number of the lienor, and the vehicle identification number if the claim of lien is for a vehicle or the hull identification number if the claim of lien is for a vessel, all of which must also appear in the return address section on the outside of the envelope containing the notice of sale. After diligent search and inquiry, if the name and address of the registered owner or the owner of the recorded lien cannot be ascertained, the requirements of notice by mail may be dispensed with. In addition to the notice by mail, public notice of the time and place of sale shall be made by publishing a notice thereof one time, at least 10 days before the date of the sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the sale is to be held. The proceeds of the sale, after payment of reasonable towing and storage charges, and costs of the sale, in that order of priority, shall be deposited with the clerk of the circuit court for the county if the owner or lienholder is absent, and the clerk shall hold such proceeds subject to the claim of the owner or lienholder legally entitled thereto. The clerk shall be entitled to receive 5 percent of such proceeds for the care and disbursement thereof. The certificate of title issued under this law shall be discharged of all liens unless otherwise provided by court order. The owner or lienholder may file a complaint after the vehicle or vessel has been sold in the county court of the county in which it is stored. Upon determining the respective rights of the parties, the court may award damages, attorney fees, and costs in favor of the prevailing party.

(7)(a)âA wrecker operator recovering, towing, or storing vehicles or vessels is not liable for damages connected with such services, theft of such vehicles or vessels, or theft of personal property contained in such vehicles or vessels, provided that such services have been performed with reasonable care and provided, further, that, in the case of removal of a vehicle or vessel upon the request of a person purporting, and reasonably appearing, to be the owner or lessee, or a person authorized by the owner or lessee, of the property from which such vehicle or vessel is removed, such removal has been done in compliance with s. [715.07](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/715.07). Further, a wrecker operator is not liable for damage to a vehicle, vessel, or cargo that obstructs the normal movement of traffic or creates a hazard to traffic and is removed in compliance with the request of a law enforcement officer.

(b)âFor the purposes of this subsection, a wrecker operator is presumed to use reasonable care to prevent the theft of a vehicle or vessel or of any personal property contained in such vehicle stored in the wrecker operatorâs storage facility if all of the following apply:

1.âThe wrecker operator surrounds the storage facility with a chain-link or solid-wall type fence at least 6 feet in height;

2.âThe wrecker operator has illuminated the storage facility with lighting of sufficient intensity to reveal persons and vehicles at a distance of at least 150 feet during nighttime; and

3.âThe wrecker operator uses one or more of the following security methods to discourage theft of vehicles or vessels or of any personal property contained in such vehicles or vessels stored in the wrecker operatorâs storage facility:

a.âA night dispatcher or watchman remains on duty at the storage facility from sunset to sunrise;

b.âA security dog remains at the storage facility from sunset to sunrise;

c.âSecurity cameras or other similar surveillance devices monitor the storage facility; or

d.âA security guard service examines the storage facility at least once each hour from sunset to sunrise.

(c)âAny law enforcement agency requesting that a motor vehicle be removed from an accident scene, street, or highway must conduct an inventory and prepare a written record of all personal property found in the vehicle before the vehicle is removed by a wrecker operator. However, if the owner or driver of the motor vehicle is present and accompanies the vehicle, no inventory by law enforcement is required. A wrecker operator is not liable for the loss of personal property alleged to be contained in such a vehicle when such personal property was not identified on the inventory record prepared by the law enforcement agency requesting the removal of the vehicle.

(8)âA person regularly engaged in the business of recovering, towing, or storing vehicles or vessels, except a person licensed under chapter 493 while engaged in ârepossessionâ activities as defined in s. [493.6101](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/493.6101), may not operate a wrecker, tow truck, or car carrier unless the name, address, and telephone number of the company performing the service is clearly printed in contrasting colors on the driver and passenger sides of its vehicle. The name must be in at least 3-inch permanently affixed letters, and the address and telephone number must be in at least 1-inch permanently affixed letters.

(9)âFailure to make good faith efforts to comply with the notice requirements of this section precludes the imposition of any storage charges against the vehicle or vessel. If a lienor fails to provide notice to a person claiming a lien on a vehicle or vessel in accordance with subsection (4), the lienor may not charge the person for more than 7 days of storage, but such failure does not affect charges made for towing the vehicle or vessel or the priority of liens on the vehicle or vessel.

(10)âPersons who provide services pursuant to this section shall permit vehicle or vessel owners, lienholders, insurance company representatives, or their agents, which agency is evidenced by an original writing acknowledged by the owner before a notary public or other person empowered by law to administer oaths, to inspect the towed vehicle or vessel and shall release to the owner, lienholder, or agent the vehicle, vessel, or all personal property not affixed to the vehicle or vessel which was in the vehicle or vessel at the time the vehicle or vessel came into the custody of the person providing such services.

(11)(a)âAny person regularly engaged in the business of recovering, towing, or storing vehicles or vessels who comes into possession of a vehicle or vessel pursuant to subsection (2) and who has complied with the provisions of subsections (3) and (6), when such vehicle or vessel is to be sold for purposes of being dismantled, destroyed, or changed in such manner that it is not the motor vehicle or vessel described in the certificate of title, shall report the vehicle to the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System and apply to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles for a certificate of destruction. A certificate of destruction, which authorizes the dismantling or destruction of the vehicle or vessel described therein, shall be reassignable a maximum of two times before dismantling or destruction of the vehicle shall be required, and shall accompany the vehicle or vessel for which it is issued, when such vehicle or vessel is sold for such purposes, in lieu of a certificate of title. The application for a certificate of destruction must include proof of reporting to the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System and an affidavit from the applicant that it has complied with all applicable requirements of this section and, if the vehicle or vessel is not registered in this state or any other state, by a statement from a law enforcement officer that the vehicle or vessel is not reported stolen, and shall be accompanied by such documentation as may be required by the department.

(b)âThe Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles shall charge a fee of $3 for each certificate of destruction. A service charge of $4.25 shall be collected and retained by the tax collector who processes the application.

(12)(a)âAny person who violates any provision of subsection (1), subsection (2), subsection (4), subsection (5), subsection (6), or subsection (7) is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. [775.082](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.082) or s. [775.083](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.083).

(b)âAny person who violates the provisions of subsections (8) through (11) is guilty of a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. [775.082](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.082), s. [775.083](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.083), or s. [775.084](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.084).

(c)âAny person who uses a false or fictitious name, gives a false or fictitious address, or makes any false statement in any application or affidavit required under the provisions of this section is guilty of a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. [775.082](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.082), s. [775.083](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.083), or s. [775.084](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.084).

(d)âEmployees of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles and law enforcement officers are authorized to inspect the records of any person regularly engaged in the business of recovering, towing, or storing vehicles or vessels or transporting vehicles or vessels by wrecker, tow truck, or car carrier, to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section. Any person who fails to maintain records, or fails to produce records when required in a reasonable manner and at a reasonable time, commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. [775.082](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.082) or s. [775.083](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.083).

(13)(a)âUpon receipt by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles of written notice from a wrecker operator who claims a wrecker operatorâs lien under paragraph (2)(d) for recovery, towing, or storage of an abandoned vehicle or vessel upon instructions from any law enforcement agency, for which a certificate of destruction has been issued under subsection (11) and the vehicle has been reported to the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System, the department shall place the name of the registered owner of that vehicle or vessel on the list of those persons who may not be issued a license plate or revalidation sticker for any motor vehicle under s. [320.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.03)(8). If the vehicle or vessel is owned jointly by more than one person, the name of each registered owner shall be placed on the list. The notice of wrecker operatorâs lien shall be submitted on forms provided by the department, which must include:

1.âThe name, address, and telephone number of the wrecker operator.

2.âThe name of the registered owner of the vehicle or vessel and the address to which the wrecker operator provided notice of the lien to the registered owner under subsection (4).

3.âA general description of the vehicle or vessel, including its color, make, model, body style, and year.

4.âThe vehicle identification number (VIN); registration license plate number, state, and year; validation decal number, state, and year; vessel registration number; hull identification number; or other identification number, as applicable.

5.âThe name of the person or the corresponding law enforcement agency that requested that the vehicle or vessel be recovered, towed, or stored.

6.âThe amount of the wrecker operatorâs lien, not to exceed the amount allowed by paragraph (b).

(b)âFor purposes of this subsection only, the amount of the wrecker operatorâs lien for which the department will prevent issuance of a license plate or revalidation sticker may not exceed the amount of the charges for recovery, towing, and storage of the vehicle or vessel for 7 days. These charges may not exceed the maximum rates imposed by the ordinances of the respective county or municipality under ss. [125.0103](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/125.0103)(1)(c) and [166.043](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/166.043)(1)(c). This paragraph does not limit the amount of a wrecker operatorâs lien claimed under subsection (2) or prevent a wrecker operator from seeking civil remedies for enforcement of the entire amount of the lien, but limits only that portion of the lien for which the department will prevent issuance of a license plate or revalidation sticker.

(c)1.âThe registered owner of a vehicle or vessel may dispute a wrecker operatorâs lien, by notifying the department of the dispute in writing on forms provided by the department, if at least one of the following applies:

a.âThe registered owner presents a notarized bill of sale proving that the vehicle or vessel was sold in a private or casual sale before the vehicle or vessel was recovered, towed, or stored.

b.âThe registered owner presents proof that the Florida certificate of title of the vehicle or vessel was sold to a licensed dealer as defined in s. [319.001](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/319.001) before the vehicle or vessel was recovered, towed, or stored.

c.âThe records of the department were marked âsoldâ prior to the date of the tow.

If the registered ownerâs dispute of a wrecker operatorâs lien complies with one of these criteria, the department shall immediately remove the registered ownerâs name from the list of those persons who may not be issued a license plate or revalidation sticker for any motor vehicle under s. [320.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.03)(8), thereby allowing issuance of a license plate or revalidation sticker. If the vehicle or vessel is owned jointly by more than one person, each registered owner must dispute the wrecker operatorâs lien in order to be removed from the list. However, the department shall deny any dispute and maintain the registered ownerâs name on the list of those persons who may not be issued a license plate or revalidation sticker for any motor vehicle under s. [320.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.03)(8) if the wrecker operator has provided the department with a certified copy of the judgment of a court which orders the registered owner to pay the wrecker operatorâs lien claimed under this section. In such a case, the amount of the wrecker operatorâs lien allowed by paragraph (b) may be increased to include no more than $500 of the reasonable costs and attorneyâs fees incurred in obtaining the judgment. The departmentâs action under this subparagraph is ministerial in nature, shall not be considered final agency action, and is appealable only to the county court for the county in which the vehicle or vessel was ordered removed.

2.âA person against whom a wrecker operatorâs lien has been imposed may alternatively obtain a discharge of the lien by filing a complaint, challenging the validity of the lien or the amount thereof, in the county court of the county in which the vehicle or vessel was ordered removed. Upon filing of the complaint, the person may have her or his name removed from the list of those persons who may not be issued a license plate or revalidation sticker for any motor vehicle under s. [320.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.03)(8), thereby allowing issuance of a license plate or revalidation sticker, upon posting with the court a cash or surety bond or other adequate security equal to the amount of the wrecker operatorâs lien to ensure the payment of such lien in the event she or he does not prevail. Upon the posting of the bond and the payment of the applicable fee set forth in s. [28.24](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/28.24), the clerk of the court shall issue a certificate notifying the department of the posting of the bond and directing the department to release the wrecker operatorâs lien. Upon determining the respective rights of the parties, the court may award damages and costs in favor of the prevailing party.

3.âIf a person against whom a wrecker operatorâs lien has been imposed does not object to the lien, but cannot discharge the lien by payment because the wrecker operator has moved or gone out of business, the person may have her or his name removed from the list of those persons who may not be issued a license plate or revalidation sticker for any motor vehicle under s. [320.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.03)(8), thereby allowing issuance of a license plate or revalidation sticker, upon posting with the clerk of court in the county in which the vehicle or vessel was ordered removed, a cash or surety bond or other adequate security equal to the amount of the wrecker operatorâs lien. Upon the posting of the bond and the payment of the application fee set forth in s. [28.24](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/28.24), the clerk of the court shall issue a certificate notifying the department of the posting of the bond and directing the department to release the wrecker operatorâs lien. The department shall mail to the wrecker operator, at the address upon the lien form, notice that the wrecker operator must claim the security within 60 days, or the security will be released back to the person who posted it. At the conclusion of the 60 days, the department shall direct the clerk as to which party is entitled to payment of the security, less applicable clerkâs fees.

4.âA wrecker operatorâs lien expires 5 years after filing.

(d)âUpon discharge of the amount of the wrecker operatorâs lien allowed by paragraph (b), the wrecker operator must issue a certificate of discharged wrecker operatorâs lien on forms provided by the department to each registered owner of the vehicle or vessel attesting that the amount of the wrecker operatorâs lien allowed by paragraph (b) has been discharged. Upon presentation of the certificate of discharged wrecker operatorâs lien by the registered owner, the department shall immediately remove the registered ownerâs name from the list of those persons who may not be issued a license plate or revalidation sticker for any motor vehicle under s. [320.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.03)(8), thereby allowing issuance of a license plate or revalidation sticker. Issuance of a certificate of discharged wrecker operatorâs lien under this paragraph does not discharge the entire amount of the wrecker operatorâs lien claimed under subsection (2), but only certifies to the department that the amount of the wrecker operatorâs lien allowed by paragraph (b), for which the department will prevent issuance of a license plate or revalidation sticker, has been discharged.

(e)âWhen a wrecker operator files a notice of wrecker operatorâs lien under this subsection, the department shall charge the wrecker operator a fee of $2, which shall be deposited into the General Revenue Fund. A service charge of $2.50 shall be collected and retained by the tax collector who processes a notice of wrecker operatorâs lien.

(f)âThis subsection applies only to the annual renewal in the registered ownerâs birth month of a motor vehicle registration and does not apply to the transfer of a registration of a motor vehicle sold by a motor vehicle dealer licensed under chapter 320, except for the transfer of registrations which includes the annual renewals. This subsection does not apply to any vehicle registered in the name of the lessor. This subsection does not affect the issuance of the title to a motor vehicle, notwithstanding s. [319.23](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/319.23)(8)(b).

(14)(a)âA copy of the notice of lien required by subsection (4) and the notice of sale required by subsection (6), which must include the vehicle identification number if the claim of lien is for a vehicle or the hull identification number if the claim of lien is for a vessel, and proof of the required check of the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System or an equivalent commercially available system shall constitute satisfactory proof for application to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles for transfer of title, together with any other proof required by any rules and regulations of the department.

(b)âThe Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles may not approve an application for transfer of title if the application fails to include a copy of the notice of lien required by subsection (4) and the notice of sale required by subsection (6). The vehicle or hull identification number on the notice of lien must match the vehicle or hull identification number of the vehicle or vessel that is the subject of the transfer of title.

(15)(a)âA lienor or the lienorâs agent may charge an administrative fee to the registered owner or a person claiming a lien against the vehicle or vessel to obtain release of the vehicle or vessel from the claim of lien imposed under this section.

713.785âLiens for recovering, towing, or storing mobile homes.â

(1)âAs used in this section, the term:

(a)ââMobile home transport companyâ means a person regularly engaged in the business of transporting mobile homes.

(b)ââStoreâ means a mobile home transport company has legal possession of a mobile home either on the mobile home transport companyâs property or on any other property.

(c)ââUnpaid lot rental amountâ or ârentâ means any unpaid financial obligations of the mobile home owner or tenant to the mobile home park owner defined as âlot rental amountâ in s. [723.003](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.003) or ârentâ in part II of chapter 83 and includes any amounts defined as storage charges in s. [723.084](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.084).

(2)âIf the mobile home transport company recovers, removes, or stores a mobile home upon instructions from:

(a)âThe owner of the mobile home;

(b)âAny law enforcement agency; or

(c)âA mobile home park owner as defined in s. [723.003](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.003) who has a current writ of possession for a mobile home lot under s. [723.062](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.062) or s. [83.62](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/83.62),

the mobile home transport company has a lien on the mobile home for a reasonable towing fee and for a reasonable storage fee.

(3)(a)âA mobile home transport company that comes into possession of a mobile home under subsection (2) and that claims a lien for recovery, towing, or storage services must give notice to the registered owner and to all persons claiming a lien on the mobile home, as disclosed by the records in the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or of a corresponding agency in any other state.

(b)âNotice by certified mail, return receipt requested, shall be sent within 7 business days after the date of storage of the mobile home to the registered owner at the ownerâs last known address, and all persons of record claiming a lien against the mobile home. The notice shall state the fact of possession of the mobile home, that a lien as provided in subsection (2) is claimed, that charges have accrued and the amount thereof, that the lien is subject to enforcement under law and that the owner or lienholder, if any, has the right to a hearing as set forth in subsection (4), and that any mobile home which remains unclaimed, or for which charges remain unpaid, may be sold free of all prior liens after 35 days following the eviction proceeding that resulted in the issuance of the writ of possession, provided that any lienholder entitled to notice pursuant to s. [723.084](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.084) has received such notice and has failed to act pursuant to s. [723.084](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.084) to pay storage charges, take possession of the home, or take legal action to foreclose its interest prior to issuance of the writ of possession.

(4)(a)âThe owner of a mobile home stored under subsection (2), or any person claiming a lien of record, other than the mobile home transport company, within 10 days after the time she or he has knowledge of the location of the mobile home, may file a complaint in the court of the county in which the mobile home is stored, to determine if her or his property was wrongfully taken or withheld from her or him.

(b)âUpon filing of a complaint, an owner or lienholder may have the mobile home released upon posting with the court a cash or surety bond or other adequate security equal to the amount of the charges for towing or storage and lot rental amount due and owing at that time to ensure the payment of the charges in the event she or he does not prevail. Upon the posting of the bond and the payment of the applicable fee set forth in s. [28.24](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/28.24), the clerk of the court shall issue a certificate notifying the mobile home transport company of the posting of the bond and directing the mobile home transport company to release the mobile home. At the time of the release, after reasonable inspection, she or he shall give a receipt to the mobile home transport company citing any claims she or he has for loss or damage to the mobile home or the contents thereof.

(c)âUpon determining the respective rights of the parties, the court may award damages and costs in favor of the prevailing party. The final order shall provide for immediate payment in full of any lien for recovery, towing, and storage fees and any unpaid lot rental amount accruing until the time the home is removed from the property, by the mobile home owner or lienholder, or the owner, lessee, or agent thereof of the property from which the mobile home was removed.

(5)âA mobile home that is stored under subsection (2) and which remains unclaimed, or for which reasonable charges for recovery, towing, or storing remain unpaid or for which a lot rental amount is due and owing to the mobile home park owner as evidenced by a judgment for unpaid rent and any contents of the mobile home not released under subsection (9), may be sold by the mobile home transport company for the towing or storage charge and any unpaid lot rental amount 35 days after the mobile home is stored by a mobile home transport company. The sale shall be at public auction for cash. If the date of the sale was not included in the notice required by subsection (3), notice of the sale must be given to the person in whose name the mobile home is registered at her or his last known address, to the mobile home park owner, and to all persons claiming a lien on the mobile home as shown on the records of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or of the corresponding agency in any other state. Notice must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, at least 15 days before the date of the sale. After diligent search and inquiry, if the name and address of the registered owner or the owner of the recorded lien cannot be ascertained, the requirements of notice by mail may be dispensed with. In addition to the notice by mail, public notice of the time and place of sale must be made by publishing a notice of the sale one time, at least 10 days before the date of the sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the sale is to be held. The proceeds of the sale, after payment of reasonable towing and storage charges, costs of the sale, and the unpaid lot rental amount as evidenced by the judgment for unpaid lot rental and an affidavit executed by the mobile home park owner or the ownerâs agent establishing the amount of unpaid lot rental amount through the date of the sale, in that order of priority, must be deposited with the clerk of the circuit court for the county if the owner is absent, and the clerk shall hold the proceeds subject to the claim of the person legally entitled to those proceeds. The clerk is entitled to receive 5 percent of the proceeds for the care and disbursement of the proceeds. The certificate of title issued under this section shall be discharged of all liens unless otherwise provided by court order.

(6)âThe mobile home transport company, the landlord or his or her agent, or any subsequent purchaser for value is not responsible to the tenant or any other party for loss, destruction, or damage to the mobile home or other personal property after coming into possession of the mobile home under this section, provided the mobile home transport company, the landlord, or their agents use reasonable care in storing the mobile home. As used in this subsection, the term âreasonable careâ means securing the mobile home by changing door locks, or any similar methods for securing the mobile home, in place in the mobile home park or in a separate storage area.

(7)(a)âA mobile home transport company that comes into possession of a mobile home under subsection (2) and that complies with subsection (3), if the mobile home is to be sold for purposes of being dismantled, destroyed, or changed so that it is not the mobile home described in the certificate of title, must apply to the county tax collector for a certificate of destruction. A certificate of destruction, which authorizes the dismantling or destruction of the mobile home described in the certificate, is reassignable no more than twice before dismantling or destruction of the mobile home, and the certificate must accompany the mobile home for which it is issued when the mobile home is sold for that purpose, in lieu of a certificate of title. The application for a certificate of destruction must include an affidavit from the applicant that it has complied with all applicable requirements of this section; must, if the mobile home is not registered in this state, include a statement from a law enforcement officer that the mobile home is not reported stolen; and shall be accompanied by any other documentation as may be required by the department.

(b)âThe Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles shall charge a fee of $3 for each certificate of destruction. The tax collector who processes the application shall collect and retain a service charge of $4.25.

(c)âEmployees of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles and law enforcement officers may inspect the records of each mobile home transport company in this state to ensure compliance with this section.

(8)(a)âUpon receipt by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles of written notice from a mobile home transport company that claims a lien under paragraph (2)(b) or paragraph (2)(c) for recovery, towing, or storage of a mobile home for which a certificate of destruction has been issued under subsection (7), the department shall place the name of the registered owner of that mobile home on the list of those persons who may not be issued a revalidation sticker under s. [320.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.03). If the mobile home is owned jointly by more than one person, the name of each registered owner must be placed on the list. The notice of a mobile home transport companyâs lien must be submitted on forms provided by the department, which must include:

1.âThe name, address, and telephone number of the mobile home transport company.

2.âThe name of the registered owner of the mobile home and the address to which the mobile home transport company provided notice of the lien to the registered owner under subsection (3).

3.âA general description of the mobile home, including its color, make, model, body style, and year.

4.âThe mobile home sticker number, state, and year or other identification number, as applicable.

5.âThe name of the person or the corresponding law enforcement agency that requested that the mobile home be recovered, towed, or stored.

6.âThe amount of the lien, not to exceed the amount allowed by paragraph (b).

(b)âFor purposes of this subsection, the amount of the mobile home transport companyâs lien for which the department will prevent issuance of a revalidation sticker may not exceed the amount of the charges for recovery, towing, and storage of the mobile home for 7 days. These charges may not exceed the maximum rates imposed by the ordinances of the respective county or municipality under ss. [125.0103](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/125.0103)(1)(c) and [166.043](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/166.043)(1)(c). This paragraph does not limit the amount of a mobile home transport companyâs lien claimed under subsection (2) or prevent a mobile home transport company from seeking civil remedies for enforcement of the entire amount of the lien, but limits only that portion of the lien for which the department will prevent issuance of a revalidation sticker.

(c)1.âThe registered owner of the mobile home may dispute the mobile home transport companyâs lien by notifying the department of the dispute in writing on forms provided by the department, if at least one of the following applies:

a.âThe registered owner presents a notarized bill of sale proving that the mobile home was sold in a private or casual sale before the mobile home was recovered, towed, or stored.

b.âThe registered owner presents proof that the Florida certificate of title of the mobile home was sold to a licensed dealer as defined in s. [319.001](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/319.001) before the mobile home was recovered, towed, or stored.

c.âThe records of the department were marked to indicate that the mobile home was sold before the issuance of the certificate of destruction under subsection (7).

If the registered ownerâs dispute of a mobile home transport companyâs lien complies with one of these criteria, the department shall immediately remove the registered ownerâs name from the list of those persons who may not be issued a revalidation sticker under s. [320.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.03). If the mobile home is owned jointly by more than one person, each registered owner must dispute the mobile home transport companyâs lien in order to be removed from the list. However, the department shall deny any dispute and maintain the registered ownerâs name on the list of those persons who may not be issued a revalidation sticker if the mobile home transport company has provided the department with a certified copy of the judgment of a court which orders the registered owner to pay the mobile home transport companyâs lien claimed under this section. In such a case, the amount of the mobile home transport companyâs lien allowed by paragraph (b) may be increased to include no more than $500 of the reasonable costs and attorneyâs fees incurred in obtaining the judgment. The departmentâs action under this subparagraph is ministerial in nature, is not final agency action, and is appealable only to the county court for the county in which the mobile home was ordered removed.

2.âA person against whom a mobile home transport companyâs lien has been imposed may alternatively obtain a discharge of the lien by filing a complaint, challenging the validity of the lien or the amount thereof, in the county court of the county in which the mobile home was ordered removed. Upon filing of the complaint, the person may have her or his name removed from the list of those persons who may not be issued a revalidation sticker for any mobile home under s. [320.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.03) upon posting with the court a cash or surety bond or other adequate security equal to the amount of the mobile home transport companyâs lien to ensure the payment of the lien in the event she or he does not prevail. Upon the posting of the bond and the payment of the applicable fee set forth in s. [28.24](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/28.24), the clerk of the court shall issue a certificate notifying the department of the posting of the bond and directing the department to release the mobile home transport companyâs lien. Upon determining the respective rights of the parties, the court may award damages and costs in favor of the prevailing party.

3.âIf a person against whom a mobile home transport companyâs lien has been imposed does not object to the lien, but cannot discharge the lien by payment because the mobile home transport company has moved or gone out of business, the person may have her or his name removed from the list of those persons who may not be issued a revalidation sticker under s. [320.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.03), upon posting with the clerk of court in the county in which the mobile home was ordered removed a cash or surety bond or other adequate security equal to the amount of the mobile home transport companyâs lien. Upon the posting of the bond and the payment of the application fee set forth in s. [28.24](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/28.24), the clerk of the court shall issue a certificate notifying the department of the posting of the bond and directing the department to release the mobile home transport companyâs lien. The department shall mail to the mobile home transport company, at the address upon the lien form, notice that the mobile home transport company must claim the security within 60 days or the security will be released to the person who posted it. At the conclusion of the 60 days, the department shall direct the clerk as to which party is entitled to payment of the security, less applicable fees of the clerk.

4.âA mobile home transport companyâs lien expires 5 years after filing.

(d)âUpon discharge of the amount of the mobile home transport companyâs lien allowed under paragraph (b), the mobile home transport company must issue a certificate of discharged lien on a form provided by the department to each registered owner of the mobile home attesting that the amount of the mobile home transport companyâs lien allowed under paragraph (b) has been discharged. Upon presentation of the certificate of discharged lien by the registered owner, the department shall immediately remove the registered ownerâs name from the list of those persons who may not be issued a revalidation sticker under s. [320.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.03). Issuance of a certificate of discharged lien under this paragraph does not discharge the entire amount of the mobile home transport companyâs lien claimed under subsection (2), but certifies to the department only that the amount of the mobile home transport companyâs lien allowed by paragraph (b), for which the department will prevent issuance of a revalidation sticker, has been discharged.

(e)âWhen a mobile home transport company files a notice of lien under this subsection, the department shall charge the mobile home transport company a fee of $2, which must be deposited into the General Revenue Fund. The tax collector who processes a notice of lien shall collect and retain a service charge of $2.50.

(9)âPersons who provide services under this section shall permit a mobile home owner or her or his agent, whose agency is evidenced by a writing acknowledged by the owner before a notary public or other person empowered by law to administer oaths, to inspect the mobile home and shall release to the owner or agent all personal property not affixed to the mobile home, provided there exists no landlordâs lien for rent under s. [713.691](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.691) or s. [713.77](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.77).

(10)âAny person who violates subsection (3), subsection (5), subsection (6), subsection (7), or subsection (9) commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. [775.082](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.082) or s. [775.083](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.083).

(1)âThe court may appoint a receiver:

(a)âBefore judgment, to protect a party that demonstrates an apparent right, title, or interest in real property that is the subject of the action, if the property or its revenue-producing potential:

1.âIs being subjected to or is in danger of waste, loss, substantial diminution in value, dissipation, or impairment; or

2.âHas been or is about to be the subject of a voidable transaction;

(b)âAfter judgment:

1.âTo carry the judgment into effect; or

2.âTo preserve nonexempt real property pending appeal or when an execution has been returned unsatisfied and the owner refuses to apply the property in satisfaction of the judgment;

(c)âIn an action in which a receiver for real property may be appointed on equitable grounds, subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b); or

(d)âDuring the time allowed for redemption, to preserve real property sold in an execution or foreclosure sale and secure its rents to the person entitled to the rents.

(2)âIn connection with the foreclosure or other enforcement of a mortgage, the court shall consider the following facts and circumstances, together with any other relevant facts, in deciding whether to appoint a receiver for the mortgaged property:

(a)âAppointment is necessary to protect the property from waste, loss, substantial diminution in value, transfer, dissipation, or impairment;

(b)âThe mortgagor agreed in a signed record to the appointment of a receiver on default;

(c)âThe owner agreed, after default and in a signed record, to appointment of a receiver;

(d)âThe property and any other collateral held by the mortgagee are not sufficient to satisfy the secured obligation;

(e)âThe owner fails to turn over to the mortgagee proceeds or rents the mortgagee was entitled to collect; or

(3)âThe court may condition the appointment of a receiver without prior notice or hearing under s. 714.03 on the giving of security by the person seeking the appointment for the payment of damages, reasonable attorney fees, and costs incurred or suffered by any person if the court later concludes that the appointment was not justified. If the court later concludes that the appointment was justified and the order of appointment of the receiver becomes final and no longer subject to appeal, the court shall release the bond or other security. When any order appointing a receiver or providing for injunctive relief is issued on the pleading of a municipality or the state, or any officer, agency, or political subdivision thereof, the court may require or dispense with a bond, with or without surety, and conditioned in the same manner, having due regard for public interest.

(4)âA party adversely affected by an order appointing a receiver may move to dissolve or modify the order at any time. If a party moves to dissolve or modify the order, the motion must be heard within 5 days after the movant applies for a hearing on the motion or at such time as the court determines is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances after the movant applies for a hearing on the motion. After notice and a hearing, the court may grant relief for cause shown.

The receiver may not use receivership property as alternative security. Interest that accrues on deposited funds must be paid to the receiver upon the receiverâs discharge.

(3)âThe court may authorize a receiver to act before the receiver posts the bond or alternative security required by this section if the action is necessary to prevent or mitigate immediate injury, loss, or damage to the party who sought the appointment of the receiver, or immediate waste, dissipation, impairment, or substantial diminution in value to the receivership property.

(4)âA claim against a receiverâs bond or alternative security must be made not later than 1 year after the date the receiver is discharged.

History.âs. 1, ch. 2020-106.

(3)âIf a creditor has possession, custody, or control of receivership property and the validity, perfection, or priority of the creditorâs lien on the property depends on the creditorâs possession, custody, or control, the creditor may retain possession, custody, or control until the court orders adequate protection of the creditorâs lien.

(4)âUnless a bona fide dispute exists about a receiverâs right to possession, custody, or control of receivership property, the court may sanction as civil contempt a personâs failure to turn the property over when required by this section.

(1)âExcept as otherwise provided in subsection (5), after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the court may enter an order providing for a stay, applicable to all persons, of any act, action, or proceeding:

(a)âTo obtain possession of, exercise control over, or enforce a judgment against all or a portion of the receivership property as defined in the order creating the stay; and

(b)âTo enforce a lien against all or a portion of the receivership property to the extent the lien secures a claim against the owner which arose before entry of the order.

The court shall include in its order a specific description of the receivership property subject to the stay, and shall include the following language in the title of the order: âOrder Staying Certain Actions to Enforce Claims against Receivership Property.â

(2)âExcept as otherwise provided in subsection (5), the court may enjoin an act, action, or proceeding against or relating to receivership property if the injunction is necessary to protect against misappropriation of, or waste relating directly to, the receivership property.

(3)âIf the court grants injunctive relief, the injunction must specify the reasons for entry and must describe in reasonable detail the act or acts restrained without reference to a pleading or other document. The injunction is binding on the parties to the action; on the partiesâ officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys; and on any person who receives actual notice of the injunction and is in active concert or participation with the parties.

(4)âA person whose act, action, or proceeding is stayed or enjoined under this section, or who is otherwise adversely affected by such stay or injunction, may apply to the court for relief from the stay or injunction. If a person moves for such relief, the motion must be heard within 5 days after the movant applies for a hearing on the motion or at such time as the court determines is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances after the movant applies for a hearing on the motion. After notice and a hearing, the court may grant relief for cause shown.

(5)âAn order under subsection (1) or subsection (2) does not operate as a stay or injunction of:

(a)âAny act, action, or proceeding to foreclose or otherwise enforce a mortgage by the person seeking appointment of the receiver;

(b)âAny act, action, or proceeding to perfect, or maintain or continue the perfection of, an interest in receivership property;

(c)âCommencement or continuation of a criminal proceeding;

(d)âCommencement or continuation of an action or proceeding, or enforcement of a judgment other than a money judgment, in an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce its police or regulatory power; or

(e)âEstablishment by a governmental unit of a tax liability against the receivership property or the owner of such receivership property, or an appeal of any such liability.

(6)âThe court may void an act that violates a stay or injunction under this section.

(7)âThe scope of the receivership property subject to the stay under subsection (1) may be modified upon request of the receiver or other person, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.

(8)âIn connection with the entry of an order under subsection (1) or subsection (2), the court shall determine whether an additional bond or alternative security will be required as a condition to entry of the stay or injunction and, if required, direct the party requesting the stay or injunction to post a bond or alternative security as a condition for the stay or injunction to become effective.

714.15âEngagement and compensation of professional.â

(1)âWith court approval, a receiver may engage an attorney, an accountant, an appraiser, an auctioneer, a broker, or another professional to assist the receiver in performing a duty or exercising a power of the receiver. The receiver shall disclose to the court:

(a)âThe identity and qualifications of the professional;

(b)âThe scope and nature of the proposed engagement;

(c)âAny potential conflict of interest; and

(d)âThe proposed compensation.

(2)âA person is not disqualified from engagement under this section solely because of the personâs engagement by, representation of, or other relationship with the receiver, a creditor, or a party. This chapter does not prevent the receiver from serving in the receivership as an attorney, an accountant, an auctioneer, or a broker when authorized by law.

(3)âA receiver or professional engaged under subsection (1) shall file with the court an itemized statement of the time spent, work performed, and billing rate of each person that performed the work and an itemized list of expenses. The receiver shall pay the amount approved by the court.

History.âs. 1, ch. 2020-106.

714.16âUse or transfer of receivership property not in ordinary course of business.â

(1)âFor the purposes of this section, the term âgood faithâ means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.

(2)âBefore judgment is entered with respect to the receivership property in the action in which the receiver is appointed, with court approval after notice to all parties with an interest in the property, including all lienholders, and a hearing, a receiver may use or transfer by sale, lease, license, exchange, or other disposition receivership property other than in the ordinary course of business only if the owner of the property:

(a)âAfter the commencement of the action in which the receiver is appointed, expressly consents in writing to the receiverâs proposed use or transfer of the receivership property, and the receiver notes the property ownerâs express consent in the motion to approve the proposed use or transfer; or

(b)âBefore or at the hearing on the receiverâs motion to approve the use or transfer of the receivership property, fails to object thereto after the receiver in good faith has provided reasonable advance written notice to the property owner of the proposed use or transfer, and the receiver demonstrates in the motion that the proposed use or transfer is necessary to prevent waste, loss, substantial diminution in value, dissipation, or impairment of the property or its revenue-producing potential or to prevent a voidable transaction involving the property.

Service of notice to lienholders who are not parties to the action must be made as provided in chapter 48 for service of original process or, in the case of a financial institution lienholder, as provided in s. 655.0201. If service cannot be effectuated in such manner, upon authorization by court order, the receiver may effect service of notice on the nonparty lienholder pursuant to chapter 49 or as otherwise ordered by the court.

(3)âAfter judgment is entered against the property owner and with court approval in the action in which the receiver is appointed, a receiver may use or transfer receivership property other than in the ordinary course of business to carry the judgment into effect or to preserve nonexempt real property pending appeal or when an execution has been returned unsatisfied and the owner refuses to apply the property in satisfaction of the judgment.

(4)âThe court may order that a transfer of receivership property under this section is free and clear of any liens on the property at the time of the transfer. In such case, any liens on the property, which were valid at the time of the transfer but extinguished by the transfer, attach to the proceeds of the transfer with the same validity, perfection, and priority the liens had on the property immediately before the transfer, even if the proceeds are not sufficient to satisfy all obligations secured by the liens.

(5)âA transfer under subsection (3) may occur by means other than a public auction sale. A creditor holding a valid lien on the property to be transferred may purchase the property and offset against the purchase price part or all of the allowed amount secured by the lien if the creditor tenders funds sufficient to satisfy in full the reasonable expenses of transfer and the obligation secured by any senior lien extinguished by the transfer.

(6)âA reversal or modification of an order approving a transfer under subsection (3) does not affect the validity of the transfer to a person that acquired the property in good faith or revive against the person any lien extinguished by the transfer, whether the person knew before the transfer of the request for reversal or modification, unless the court stayed the order before the transfer.

History.âs. 1, ch. 2020-106.

714.17âExecutory contract.â

(1)âFor the purposes of this section, the term âtimeshare interestâ has the same meaning as in s. 721.05(36).

(2)âExcept as otherwise provided in subsection (8), with court approval, a receiver may adopt or reject an executory contract of the owner relating to receivership property. The court may condition the receiverâs adoption and continued performance of the contract on terms appropriate under the circumstances. If the receiver does not request court approval to adopt or reject the contract within a reasonable time after the receiverâs appointment, the receiver is deemed to have rejected the contract.

(3)âA receiverâs performance of an executory contract before court approval under subsection (2) of its adoption or rejection is not an adoption of the contract and does not preclude the receiver from seeking approval to reject the contract.

(4)âA provision in an executory contract which requires or permits a forfeiture, modification, or termination of the contract because of the appointment of a receiver or the financial condition of the owner does not affect a receiverâs power under subsection (2) to adopt the contract.

(5)âA receiverâs right to possess or use receivership property pursuant to an executory contract terminates on rejection of the contract under subsection (2). Rejection is a breach of the contract effective immediately before appointment of the receiver. A claim for damages for rejection of the contract must be submitted by the later of:

(a)âThe time set for submitting a claim in the receivership; or

(b)âThirty days after the court approves the rejection.

(6)âIf at the time a receiver is appointed, the owner has the right to assign an executory contract relating to receivership property under the laws of this state other than this chapter, the receiver may assign the contract with court approval.

(7)âIf a receiver rejects an executory contract for the sale of receivership property that is real property in possession of the purchaser or a real-property timeshare interest pursuant to subsection (2), the purchaser may:

(a)âTreat the rejection as a termination of the contract, and in that case the purchaser has a lien on the property for the recovery of any part of the purchase price the purchaser paid; or

(b)âRetain the purchaserâs right to possession under the contract. If the purchaser retains his or her right to possession pursuant to this paragraph, the purchaser must continue to perform all obligations arising under the contract and may offset any damages caused by nonperformance of an obligation of the owner after the date of the rejection, but the purchaser does not have a right or claim against other receivership property or the receiver on account of the damages.

(8)âA receiver may not reject an unexpired lease of real property under which the owner is the landlord if:

(a)âThe tenant occupies the leased premises as the tenantâs primary residence;

(b)âThe receiver was appointed at the request of a person other than a mortgagee; or

(c)âThe receiver was appointed at the request of a mortgagee and:

1.âThe lease is superior to the lien of the mortgage;

2.âThe tenant has an enforceable agreement with the mortgagee or the holder of a senior lien under which the tenantâs occupancy will not be disturbed as long as the tenant performs its obligations under the lease;

3.âThe mortgagee has consented to the lease, either in a signed record or by its failure to timely object that the lease violated the mortgage; or

4.âThe terms of the lease were commercially reasonable at the time the lease was agreed to and the tenant did not know or have reason to know that the lease violated the mortgage.

714.18âDefenses and immunities of receiver.â

(2)âA receiver may be sued personally for an act or omission in administering receivership property only with approval of the court that appointed the receiver.

(1)âThe activities of the receiver since appointment or a previous report;

(2)âReceipts and disbursements, including a payment made or proposed to be made to a professional engaged by the receiver;

(3)âReceipts and dispositions of receivership property;

History.âs. 1, ch. 2020-106.

714.20âNotice of appointment; claim against receivership; distribution to creditors.â

(1)âExcept as otherwise provided in subsection (6), a receiver shall give notice of appointment of the receiver to creditors of the owner by:

(a)âDeposit for delivery through first-class mail or other commercially reasonable delivery method to the last known address of each creditor; and

(b)âPublication as directed by the court.

(2)âExcept as otherwise provided in subsection (6), the notice required under subsection (1) must specify the date by which each creditor holding a claim against the owner which arose before appointment of the receiver must submit the claim to the receiver. The date specified must be at least 90 days after the later of notice under paragraph (1)(a) or last publication under paragraph (1)(b). The court may extend the period for submitting the claim. Unless the court orders otherwise, a claim that is not timely submitted is not entitled to a distribution from the receivership.

(3)âA claim submitted by a creditor under this section must:

(a)âState the name and address of the creditor;

(b)âState the amount and basis of the claim;

(c)âIdentify any property securing the claim;

(d)âBe signed by the creditor under penalty of perjury; and

(e)âInclude a copy of any record on which the claim is based.

(4)âAn assignment by a creditor of a claim against the owner is effective against the receiver only if the assignee gives timely notice of the assignment to the receiver in a signed record.

(5)âAt any time before entry of an order approving a receiverâs final report, the receiver may file with the court an objection to a claim of a creditor, stating the basis for the objection. The court shall allow or disallow the claim according to the laws of this state other than this chapter.

(6)âIf the court concludes that receivership property is likely to be insufficient to satisfy claims of each creditor holding a perfected lien on the property, the court may order that:

(a)âThe receiver need not give notice under subsection (1) of the appointment to all creditors of the owner, but only such creditors as the court directs; and

(b)âUnsecured creditors need not submit claims under this section.

(7)âSubject to s. 714.21:

(a)âA distribution of receivership property to a creditor holding a perfected lien on the property must be made in accordance with the creditorâs priority under the laws of this state other than this chapter; and

(a)âA person that requested the appointment of the receiver, if the receivership does not produce sufficient funds to pay the fees and expenses; or

(4)âThe court may discharge a receiver and terminate the courtâs administration of the receivership property if the court finds that appointment of the receiver was improvident or that the circumstances no longer warrant continuation of the receivership. If the court finds that the appointment was sought wrongfully or in bad faith, the court may assess against the person that sought the appointment:

(a)âThe fees and expenses of the receivership, including reasonable attorney fees and costs; and

(b)âActual damages caused by the appointment, including reasonable attorney fees and costs.

(d)âDuring the time allowed for redemption, to preserve real property sold in an execution or foreclosure sale and secure its rents to the person entitled to the rents.

If the court later concludes that the appointment was justified and the order of appointment of the receiver becomes final and no longer subject to appeal, the court shall release the bond or other security. When any order appointing a receiver or providing for injunctive relief is issued on the pleading of a municipality or the state, or any officer, agency, or political subdivision thereof, the court may require or dispense with a bond, with or without surety, and conditioned in the same manner, having due regard for public interest.

(4)âA party adversely affected by an order appointing a receiver may move to dissolve or modify the order at any time.

(1)âFor the purposes of this section, the term âgood faithâ means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.

(2)âBefore judgment is entered with respect to the receivership property in the action in which the receiver is appointed, with court approval after notice to all parties with an interest in the property, including all lienholders, and a hearing, a receiver may use or transfer by sale, lease, license, exchange, or other disposition receivership property other than in the ordinary course of business only if the owner of the property:

(a)âAfter the commencement of the action in which the receiver is appointed, expressly consents in writing to the receiverâs proposed use or transfer of the receivership property, and the receiver notes the property ownerâs express consent in the motion to approve the proposed use or transfer; or

(b)âBefore or at the hearing on the receiverâs motion to approve the use or transfer of the receivership property, fails to object thereto after the receiver in good faith has provided reasonable advance written notice to the property owner of the proposed use or transfer, and the receiver demonstrates in the motion that the proposed use or transfer is necessary to prevent waste, loss, substantial diminution in value, dissipation, or impairment of the property or its revenue-producing potential or to prevent a voidable transaction involving the property.

Service of notice to lienholders who are not parties to the action must be made as provided in chapter 48 for service of original process or, in the case of a financial institution lienholder, as provided in s. [655.0201](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/655.0201). If service cannot be effectuated in such manner, upon authorization by court order, the receiver may effect service of notice on the nonparty lienholder pursuant to chapter 49 or as otherwise ordered by the court.

(3)âAfter judgment is entered against the property owner and with court approval in the action in which the receiver is appointed, a receiver may use or transfer receivership property other than in the ordinary course of business to carry the judgment into effect or to preserve nonexempt real property pending appeal or when an execution has been returned unsatisfied and the owner refuses to apply the property in satisfaction of the judgment.

(4)âThe court may order that a transfer of receivership property under this section is free and clear of any liens on the property at the time of the transfer. In such case, any liens on the property, which were valid at the time of the transfer but extinguished by the transfer, attach to the proceeds of the transfer with the same validity, perfection, and priority the liens had on the property immediately before the transfer, even if the proceeds are not sufficient to satisfy all obligations secured by the liens.

(5)âA transfer under subsection (3) may occur by means other than a public auction sale. A creditor holding a valid lien on the property to be transferred may purchase the property and offset against the purchase price part or all of the allowed amount secured by the lien if the creditor tenders funds sufficient to satisfy in full the reasonable expenses of transfer and the obligation secured by any senior lien extinguished by the transfer.

(6)âA reversal or modification of an order approving a transfer under subsection (3) does not affect the validity of the transfer to a person that acquired the property in good faith or revive against the person any lien extinguished by the transfer, whether the person knew before the transfer of the request for reversal or modification, unless the court stayed the order before the transfer.

(6)âIf the court concludes that receivership property is likely to be insufficient to satisfy claims of each creditor holding a perfected lien on the property, the court may order that:

(a)âThe receiver need not give notice under subsection (1) of the appointment to all creditors of the owner, but only such creditors as the court directs; and

(b)âUnsecured creditors need not submit claims under this section.

(4)âThe court may discharge a receiver and terminate the courtâs administration of the receivership property if the court finds that appointment of the receiver was improvident or that the circumstances no longer warrant continuation of the receivership.

(1)âAs used in this section, the term:

(a)ââVehicleâ means any mobile item which normally uses wheels, whether motorized or not.

(b)ââVesselâ means every description of watercraft, barge, and airboat used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, other than a seaplane or a âdocumented vesselâ as defined in s. [327.02](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/327.02).

(2)âThe owner or lessee of real property, or any person authorized by the owner or lessee, which person may be the designated representative of the condominium association if the real property is a condominium, may cause any vehicle or vessel parked on such property without her or his permission to be removed by a person regularly engaged in the business of towing vehicles or vessels, without liability for the costs of removal, transportation, or storage or damages caused by such removal, transportation, or storage, under any of the following circumstances:

(a)âThe towing or removal of any vehicle or vessel from private property without the consent of the registered owner or other legally authorized person in control of that vehicle or vessel is subject to substantial compliance with the following conditions and restrictions:

1.a.âAny towed or removed vehicle or vessel must be stored at a site within a 10-mile radius of the point of removal in any county of 500,000 population or more, and within a 15-mile radius of the point of removal in any county of fewer than 500,000 population. That site must be open for the purpose of redemption of vehicles on any day that the person or firm towing such vehicle or vessel is open for towing purposes, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., and, when closed, shall have prominently posted a sign indicating a telephone number where the operator of the site can be reached at all times. Upon receipt of a telephoned request to open the site to redeem a vehicle or vessel, the operator shall return to the site within 1 hour or she or he will be in violation of this section.

b.âIf no towing business providing such service is located within the area of towing limitations set forth in sub-subparagraph a., the following limitations apply: any towed or removed vehicle or vessel must be stored at a site within a 20-mile radius of the point of removal in any county of 500,000 population or more, and within a 30-mile radius of the point of removal in any county of fewer than 500,000 population.

2.âThe person or firm towing or removing the vehicle or vessel shall, within 30 minutes after completion of such towing or removal, notify the municipal police department or, in an unincorporated area, the sheriff, of such towing or removal, the storage site, the time the vehicle or vessel was towed or removed, and the make, model, color, and license plate number of the vehicle or description and registration number of the vessel and shall obtain the name of the person at that department to whom such information was reported and note that name on the trip record.

3.âA person in the process of towing or removing a vehicle or vessel from the premises or parking lot in which the vehicle or vessel is not lawfully parked must stop when a person seeks the return of the vehicle or vessel. The vehicle or vessel must be returned upon the payment of a reasonable service fee of not more than one-half of the posted rate for the towing or removal service as provided in subparagraph 6. The vehicle or vessel may be towed or removed if, after a reasonable opportunity, the owner or legally authorized person in control of the vehicle or vessel is unable to pay the service fee. If the vehicle or vessel is redeemed, a detailed signed receipt must be given to the person redeeming the vehicle or vessel.

4.âA person may not pay or accept money or other valuable consideration for the privilege of towing or removing vehicles or vessels from a particular location.

5.âExcept for property appurtenant to and obviously a part of a single-family residence, and except for instances when notice is personally given to the owner or other legally authorized person in control of the vehicle or vessel that the area in which that vehicle or vessel is parked is reserved or otherwise unavailable for unauthorized vehicles or vessels and that the vehicle or vessel is subject to being removed at the ownerâs or operatorâs expense, any property owner or lessee, or person authorized by the property owner or lessee, before towing or removing any vehicle or vessel from private property without the consent of the owner or other legally authorized person in control of that vehicle or vessel, must post a notice meeting the following requirements:

a.âThe notice must be prominently placed at each driveway access or curb cut allowing vehicular access to the property within 10 feet from the road, as defined in s. [334.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/334.03)(22). If there are no curbs or access barriers, the signs must be posted not fewer than one sign for each 25 feet of lot frontage.

b.âThe notice must clearly indicate, in not fewer than 2-inch high, light-reflective letters on a contrasting background, that unauthorized vehicles will be towed away at the ownerâs expense. The words âtow-away zoneâ must be included on the sign in not fewer than 4-inch high letters.

c.âThe notice must also provide the name and current telephone number of the person or firm towing or removing the vehicles or vessels.

d.âThe sign structure containing the required notices must be permanently installed with the words âtow-away zoneâ not fewer than 3 feet and not more than 6 feet above ground level and must be continuously maintained on the property for not fewer than 24 hours before the towing or removal of any vehicles or vessels.

e.âThe local government may require permitting and inspection of these signs before any towing or removal of vehicles or vessels being authorized.

f.âA business with 20 or fewer parking spaces satisfies the notice requirements of this subparagraph by prominently displaying a sign stating âReserved Parking for Customers Only Unauthorized Vehicles or Vessels Will be Towed Away At the Ownerâs Expenseâ in not fewer than 4-inch high, light-reflective letters on a contrasting background.

g.âA property owner towing or removing vessels from real property must post notice, consistent with the requirements in sub-subparagraphs a.-f., which apply to vehicles, that unauthorized vehicles or vessels will be towed away at the ownerâs expense.

A business owner or lessee may authorize the removal of a vehicle or vessel by a towing company when the vehicle or vessel is parked in such a manner that restricts the normal operation of business; and if a vehicle or vessel parked on a public right-of-way obstructs access to a private driveway the owner, lessee, or agent may have the vehicle or vessel removed by a towing company upon signing an order that the vehicle or vessel be removed without a posted tow-away zone sign.

6.âAny person or firm that tows or removes vehicles or vessels and proposes to require an owner, operator, or person in control or custody of a vehicle or vessel to pay the costs of towing and storage before redemption of the vehicle or vessel must file and keep on record with the local law enforcement agency a complete copy of the current rates to be charged for such services and post at the storage site an identical rate schedule and any written contracts with property owners, lessees, or persons in control of property which authorize such person or firm to remove vehicles or vessels as provided in this section.

7.âAny person or firm towing or removing any vehicles or vessels from private property without the consent of the owner or other legally authorized person in control or custody of the vehicles or vessels shall, on any trucks, wreckers as defined in s. [713.78](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.78)(1)(c), or other vehicles used in the towing or removal, have the name, address, and telephone number of the company performing such service clearly printed in contrasting colors on the driver and passenger sides of the vehicle. The name shall be in at least 3-inch permanently affixed letters, and the address and telephone number shall be in at least 1-inch permanently affixed letters.

8.âVehicle entry for the purpose of removing the vehicle or vessel shall be allowed with reasonable care on the part of the person or firm towing the vehicle or vessel. Such person or firm shall be liable for any damage occasioned to the vehicle or vessel if such entry is not in accordance with the standard of reasonable care.

9.âWhen a vehicle or vessel has been towed or removed pursuant to this section, it must be released to its owner or person in control or custody within 1 hour after requested. Any vehicle or vessel owner or person in control or custody has the right to inspect the vehicle or vessel before accepting its return, and no release or waiver of any kind which would release the person or firm towing the vehicle or vessel from liability for damages noted by the owner or person in control or custody at the time of the redemption may be required from any vehicle or vessel owner or person in control or custody as a condition of release of the vehicle or vessel to its owner or person in control or custody. A detailed receipt showing the legal name of the company or person towing or removing the vehicle or vessel must be given to the person paying towing or storage charges at the time of payment, whether requested or not.

(b)âThese requirements are minimum standards and do not preclude enactment of additional regulations by any municipality or county including the right to regulate rates when vehicles or vessels are towed from private property.

(3)âThis section does not apply to law enforcement, firefighting, rescue squad, ambulance, or other emergency vehicles or vessels that are marked as such or to property owned by any governmental entity.

(4)âWhen a person improperly causes a vehicle or vessel to be removed, such person shall be liable to the owner or lessee of the vehicle or vessel for the cost of removal, transportation, and storage; any damages resulting from the removal, transportation, or storage of the vehicle or vessel; attorneyâs fees; and court costs.

(5)(a)âAny person who violates subparagraph (2)(a)2. or subparagraph (2)(a)6. commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. [775.082](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.082) or s. [775.083](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.083).

(b)âAny person who violates subparagraph (2)(a)1., subparagraph (2)(a)3., subparagraph (2)(a)4., subparagraph (2)(a)7., or subparagraph (2)(a)9. commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. [775.082](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.082), s. [775.083](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.083), or s.

(1)âThe personal property described in the notice shall be released by the landlord to the former tenant or, at the landlordâs option, to any person reasonably believed by the landlord to be its owner, if such tenant or other person pays the reasonable costs of storage and advertising and takes possession of the property not later than the date specified in the notice for taking possession.

(2)âWhere personal property is not released pursuant to subsection (1) and the notice has stated that the personal property will be sold at a public sale, the landlord shall release the personal property to the former tenant if she or he claims it prior to the time it is sold and pays the reasonable costs of storage, advertising, and sale incurred prior to the time the property is withdrawn from sale.

(1)âIf the personal property described in the notice is not released pursuant to s. [715.108](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/715.108), it shall be sold at public sale by competitive bidding. However, if the landlord reasonably believes that the total resale value of the property not released is less than $500, she or he may retain such property for her or his own use or dispose of it in any manner she or he chooses. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the landlord or tenant from bidding on the property at the public sale. The successful bidderâs title is subject to ownership rights, liens, and security interests which have priority by law.

(2)âNotice of the time and place of the public sale shall be given by an advertisement of the sale published once a week for 2 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held. The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to that where the personal property is held or stored. The advertisement must include a description of the goods, the name of the former tenant, and the time and place of the sale. The sale must take place at least 10 days after the first publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement must be posted at least 10 days before the sale in not less than six conspicuous places in the neighborhood of the proposed sale. The last publication shall be at least 5 days before the sale is to be held. Notice of sale may be published before the last of the dates specified for taking possession of the property in any notice given pursuant to s. [715.104](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/715.104).

(3)âThe notice of the sale shall describe the property to be sold in a manner reasonably adequate to permit the owner of the property to identify it. The notice may describe all or a portion of the property, but the limitation of liability provided by s. [715.11](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/715.11) does not protect the landlord from any liability arising from the disposition of property not described in the notice, except that a trunk, valise, box, or other container which is locked, fastened, or tied in a manner which deters immediate access to its contents may be described as such without describing its contents.

715.12âConstruction Contract Prompt Payment Law.â

(1)âThis section may be cited as the âConstruction Contract Prompt Payment Law.â

(2)âThis section applies only to written contracts to improve real property entered into after December 31, 1992, and for which a construction lien is authorized under part I of chapter 713.

(3)âThe terms used in this section have the same definitions as the terms defined in s. [713.01](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.01). As used in this section, the term:

(a)ââObligorâ means an owner, contractor, subcontractor, or sub-subcontractor who has an obligation to make payments under a contract that is subject to this section.

(b)ââObligeeâ means a contractor, subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, or materialman who is entitled to receive payments under a contract that is subject to this section.

(c)ââChain of contractsâ means the contracts between the owner and the contractor, the contractor and any subcontractor or materialman, the subcontractor and any sub-subcontractor or materialman, and the sub-subcontractor and any materialman.

(4)âAn obligor must pay an obligee with whom the obligor has a contract when all of the following events have occurred:

(a)âThe obligee is entitled to a payment at the time and under the terms specified in the contract between the obligor and the obligee, and the obligee has furnished the obligor with a written request for payment; and

(b)âThe obligor, except an owner, has been paid for the obligeeâs labor, services, or materials described in the obligeeâs request for payment by the person immediately above the obligor in the chain of contracts; and

(c)âThe obligee has furnished the obligor with all affidavits or waivers required for the owner to make proper payments under s. [713.06](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.06).

(5)(a)âAny payment due under the provisions of subsection (4), excluding any amounts withheld pursuant to subsection (7), shall bear interest at the rate specified in s. [55.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/55.03) plus an additional 12 percent per annum, computed beginning on the 14th day after payment is due pursuant to subsection (4).

(b)âIf the request for payment is incomplete or contains an error, the obligor has 14 days within which to return the request for payment to the obligee for completion or correction. The obligor must specify in writing the reasons for the return of the request for payment. If the obligor does not return the request for payment, together with the specified reasons within the time provided in paragraph (a), the obligor must pay interest as provided in paragraph (a). If the obligor does return the request for payment within the time provided in paragraph (a), the time period for computing interest begins to run on the 14th day after the request for payment is completed or corrected and payment is otherwise due pursuant to subsection (4).

(6)(a)âThe right to receive interest on a payment under this section is not an exclusive remedy. This section does not modify the remedies available to any person under the terms of a contract or under any other statute. This section does not modify the rights of any person to recover prejudgment interest awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action or arbitration case. During the period that interest accrues under this section, the interest rate shall be the rate specified in s. [55.03](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/55.03) plus an additional 12 percent per annum or the rate specified in the contract, whichever is greater. A person shall not be entitled to receive both the contract interest and the statutory interest specified in this section.

(b)âThis section does not create a separate cause of action other than for the collection of interest due pursuant to subsection (5).

(c)âIf an obligor pays an amount less than the full amount due under the contract between the obligor and the obligee, the obligor may designate the portion of the labor, services, or materials to which the payment applies. In the absence of such a designation by the obligor, the obligee may apply the payment in any manner the obligee deems appropriate. This paragraph does not modify the obligation to make or demand a designation under the provisions of s. [713.14](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/713.14).

(d)âAn obligee may not waive the right to receive interest before a payment is due under a contract subject to this section. An obligee may waive the interest due on any late payment on or after the date the payment is due under subsection (4).

(e)âUnless the contract specifically provides to the contrary, a dispute between an obligor and obligee does not permit the obligor to withhold payment from the obligee or from any other obligee for labor, services, or materials provided to the obligor and which are not subject to or affected by the dispute.

(7)(a)âAn owner and a contractor may agree to a provision that allows the owner to withhold a portion of each progress payment until substantial completion of the entire project. The owner shall pay the contractor the balance of the contract price, including the amounts withheld from the progress payments, within 14 days after any of the following events occur.

1.âPursuant to the terms of the contract, an architect or engineer certifies that the project is substantially complete and, within the time provided in the contract between the owner and the contractor, the owner submits a written punchlist to the contractor and the contractor substantially completes all of the items on the punchlist.

2.âThe issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the project, and within the time provided in the contract between the owner and the contractor, the owner submits a written punchlist to the contractor and the contractor substantially completes all of the items on the punchlist.

3.âThe owner or a tenant of the owner takes possession of the construction project and, within the time provided in the contract between the owner and the contractor, the owner submits a written punchlist to the contractor and the contractor substantially completes all of the items on the punchlist.

Any funds retained by the owner beyond the time period specified in this subsection shall accrue interest at the rate specified in subsection (5), computed from the date the payment is due to the date the payment is received by the contractor. If the contract between the owner and the contractor does not provide a time period for the owner to submit a written punchlist to the contractor, the time period shall be 15 days from the issuance of the certificate of substantial completion, the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, or the date the owner or the ownerâs tenant takes possession of the project, whichever first occurs. If no written punchlist is given to the contractor within the time provided in this subsection, interest begins to accrue 14 days after the issuance of the certificate of substantial completion, the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, or the date the owner or the ownerâs tenant takes possession of the project, whichever first occurs. For construction projects that are to be built in phases, this subsection applies to each phase of the total project. The contract between the owner and the contractor may specify a shorter time period for disbursing all or any portion of the final payment and the retainage.

(b)âExcept as provided in paragraph (a), an obligor and obligee may agree to a provision that allows the obligor to withhold a portion of each progress payment until completion of the entire project. The amounts withheld shall bear interest 14 days after payment of such amounts are due under the terms of the contract between the obligor and obligee and the other requirements of subsection (4) have been satisfied.

(c)âAn obligee may, from time to time, withdraw all or any portion of the amount retained from progress payments upon depositing with the obligor:

1.âUnited States Treasury bonds, United States Treasury notes, United States Treasury certificates of indebtedness, or United States Treasury bills;

2.âBonds or notes of the State of Florida; or

3.âCertificates of deposit, within the insured limits, from a state or national bank or state or federal savings and loan association authorized to do business in this state.

Amounts may not be withdrawn in excess of the market value of the securities listed in subparagraphs 1., 2., and 3. at the time of such withdrawal or in excess of the par value of such securities, whichever is less. The obligee shall execute and deliver all documents reasonably required to allow the obligor to document the transfer and the obligee shall pay any recording or registration costs incurred by the obligor in connection with the transfer. The obligor shall pay the obligee any interest or income earned on the securities so deposited within 30 days after the date such interest or income is received by the obligor. If the deposit is in the form of coupon bonds, the obligor shall deliver each coupon to the obligee within 30 days after the date the coupon matures. An obligee may withdraw funds retained from progress payments only to the extent the obligor has withdrawn such funds for the obligeeâs labor, services, or materials from the person immediately above the obligor in the chain of contracts.

717.107âFunds owing under life insurance policies, annuity contracts, and retained asset accounts; fines, penalties, and interest; United States Social Security Administration Death Master File.â

(1)âFunds held or owing under any life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract which has matured or terminated are presumed unclaimed if unclaimed for more than 5 years after the date of death of the insured, the annuitant, or the retained asset account holder, but property described in paragraph (3)(d) is presumed unclaimed if such property is not claimed for more than 2 years. The amount presumed unclaimed shall include any amount due and payable under s. [627.4615](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/627.4615).

(2)âIf a person other than the insured, the annuitant, or the retained asset account holder is entitled to the funds and no address of the person is known to the company or it is not definite and certain from the records of the company who is entitled to the funds, it is presumed that the last known address of the person entitled to the funds is the same as the last known address of the insured, the annuitant, or the retained asset account holder according to the records of the company.

(3)âFor purposes of this chapter, a life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract not matured by actual proof of the death of the insured, the annuitant, or the retained asset account holder according to the records of the company is deemed matured and the proceeds due and payable if any of the following applies:

(a)âThe company knows that the insured, the annuitant, or the retained asset account holder has died.

(b)âA presumption of death made in accordance with paragraph (8)(c) has not been rebutted.

(c)âThe policy or contract has reached its maturity date.

(d)1.âThe insured has attained, or would have attained if he or she were living, the limiting age under the mortality table on which the reserve is based;

2.âThe policy was in force at the time the insured attained, or would have attained, the limiting age specified in subparagraph 1.; and

3.âNeither the insured nor any other person appearing to have an interest in the policy within the preceding 2 years, according to the records of the company, has assigned, readjusted, or paid premiums on the policy; subjected the policy to a loan; corresponded in writing with the company concerning the policy; or otherwise indicated an interest as evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file prepared by an employee of the company.

(4)âFor purposes of this chapter, the application of an automatic premium loan provision or other nonforfeiture provision contained in an insurance policy does not prevent the policy from being matured or terminated under subsection (1) if the insured has died or the insured or the beneficiaries of the policy otherwise have become entitled to the proceeds thereof before the depletion of the cash surrender value of a policy by the application of those provisions.

(5)âIf the laws of this state or the terms of the life insurance policy require the company to give notice to the insured or owner that an automatic premium loan provision or other nonforfeiture provision has been exercised and the notice, given to an insured or owner whose last known address according to the records of the company is in this state, is undeliverable, the company shall make a reasonable search to ascertain the policyholderâs correct address to which the notice must be mailed.

(6)âNotwithstanding any other provision of law, if the company learns of the death of the insured, the annuitant, or the retained asset account holder and the beneficiary has not communicated with the insurer within 4 months after the death, the company shall take reasonable steps to pay the proceeds to the beneficiary.

(7)âCommencing 2 years after July 1, 1987, every change of beneficiary form issued by an insurance company under any life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract to an insured or owner who is a resident of this state must request the following information:

(a)âThe name of each beneficiary, or if a class of beneficiaries is named, the name of each current beneficiary in the class.

(b)âThe address of each beneficiary.

(c)âThe relationship of each beneficiary to the insured.

(8)(a)âNotwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer shall compare the records of its insuredsâ life or endowment insurance policies, annuity contracts that provide a death benefit, and retained asset accounts that were in force at any time on or after January 1, 1992, against the United States Social Security Administration Death Master File once to determine whether the death of an insured, an annuitant, or a retained asset account holder is indicated and shall thereafter use the Death Master File update files for future comparisons. The comparisons must use the name and social security number or date of birth of the insured, the annuitant, or the retained asset account holder. The comparisons must be made on at least an annual basis before August 31 of each year. If an insurer performs such comparisons regarding its annuities or other books of business more frequently than once a year, the insurer must also make comparisons regarding its life insurance policies, annuity contracts that provide a death benefit, and retained asset accounts at the same frequency as is made regarding its annuities or other books or lines of business. An insurer may perform the comparisons required by this paragraph using any database or service that the department determines is at least as comprehensive as the United States Social Security Administration Death Master File for the purpose of indicating that a person has died.

(b)âHowever, an insurer that meets one of the following criteria as of June 30, 2016, shall conduct the comparison in paragraph (a) to all in-force policies:

1.âThe insurer has entered into a regulatory settlement agreement with the Office of Insurance Regulation; or

2.âThe insurer has received a targeted market conduct examination report issued by the Office of Insurance Regulation regarding claims-handling practices and the use of the Death Master File with no findings of violations of law.

(c)âAn insured, an annuitant, or a retained asset account holder is presumed deceased if the date of his or her death is indicated by the comparison required under paragraph (a) unless the insurer has in its records competent and substantial evidence that the person is living, including, but not limited to, a contact made by the insurer with such person or his or her legal representative. The insurer shall account for common variations in data and for any partial names, social security numbers, dates of birth, and addresses of the insured, the annuitant, or the retained asset account holder which would otherwise preclude an exact match.

(d)âFor purposes of this section, a policy, an annuity contract, or a retained asset account is deemed to be in force if it has not lapsed, has not been canceled, or has not been terminated at the time of death of the insured, the annuitant, or the retained asset account holder.

(e)âThis subsection does not apply to an insurer with respect to benefits payable under:

1.âAn annuity that is issued in connection with an employment-based plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or that is issued to fund an employment-based retirement plan, including any deferred compensation plan.

2.âA policy of credit life or accidental death insurance.

3.âA joint and survivor annuity contract if an annuitant is still living.

4.âA policy issued to a group master policy owner for which the insurer does not perform recordkeeping functions. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ârecordkeepingâ means those circumstances under which the insurer has agreed through a group policyholder to be responsible for obtaining, maintaining, and administering, in its own or its agentsâ systems, information about each individual insured under a group insurance policy or a line of coverage thereunder, including at least the following:

a.âThe social security number, or name and date of birth;

b.âBeneficiary designation information;

c.âCoverage eligibility;

d.âThe benefit amount; and

e.âPremium payment status.

5.âAny policy or certificate of life insurance that is assigned to a person licensed under s. [497.452](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/497.452) to fund a preneed funeral merchandise or service contract.

(9)âNo later than 120 days after learning of the death of an insured, an annuitant, or a retained asset account holder through a comparison under subsection (8), an insurer shall:

(a)âComplete and document an effort to confirm the death of the insured, the annuitant, or the retained asset account holder against other available records and information.

(b)âReview its records to determine whether the insured, the annuitant, or the retained asset account holder purchased other products from the insurer.

(c)âDetermine whether benefits may be due under a policy, an annuity, or a retained asset account.

(d)âComplete and document an effort to locate and contact the beneficiary or authorized representative under a policy, an annuity, or a retained asset account if such person has not communicated with the insurer before the expiration of the 120-day period. The effort must include:

1.âSending to the beneficiary or authorized representative information concerning the claim process of the insurer.

2.âNotice of any requirement to provide a certified original or copy of the death certificate if applicable under the policy, annuity, or retained asset account.

(10)âAn insurer may, to the extent permitted by law, disclose the minimum necessary personal information about an insured, an annuitant, a retained asset account owner, or a beneficiary to an individual or entity reasonably believed by the insurer to possess the ability to assist the insurer in locating the beneficiary or any other individual or entity that is entitled to payment of the claim proceeds.

(11)âAn insurer, or any agent or third party that it engages or that works on its behalf, may not charge insureds, annuitants, retained asset account holders, beneficiaries, or the estates of insureds, annuitants, retained asset account holders, or the beneficiaries of an estate any fees or costs associated with any search, verification, claim, or delivery of funds conducted pursuant to this section.

(1)âEvery person holding funds or other property, tangible or intangible, presumed unclaimed and subject to custody as unclaimed property under this chapter shall report to the department on such forms as the department may prescribe by rule. In lieu of forms, a report identifying 25 or more different apparent owners must be submitted by the holder via electronic medium as the department may prescribe by rule. The report must include:

(a)âExcept for travelerâs checks and money orders, the name, social security number or taxpayer identification number, and date of birth, if known, and last known address, if any, of each person appearing from the records of the holder to be the owner of any property which is presumed unclaimed and which has a value of $50 or more.

(b)âFor unclaimed funds which have a value of $50 or more held or owing under any life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract, the full name, taxpayer identification number or social security number, date of birth, if known, and last known address of the insured or annuitant and of the beneficiary according to records of the insurance company holding or owing the funds.

(c)âFor all tangible property held in a safe-deposit box or other safekeeping repository, a description of the property and the place where the property is held and may be inspected by the department, and any amounts owing to the holder.

(d)âThe nature and identifying number, if any, or description of the property and the amount appearing from the records to be due. Items of value under $50 each may be reported in the aggregate.

(e)âThe date the property became payable, demandable, or returnable, and the date of the last transaction with the apparent owner with respect to the property.

(f)âAny person or business association or public corporation holding funds presumed unclaimed and having a total value of $10 or less may file a zero balance report for that reporting period. The balance brought forward to the new reporting period is zero.

Compliance with this subsection means the holder exercises reasonable and prudent efforts to determine the names of all prior holders.

(3)âThe report must be filed before May 1 of each year. The report shall apply to the preceding calendar year. The department may impose and collect a penalty of $10 per day up to a maximum of $500 for the failure to timely report or the failure to include in a report information required by this chapter. The penalty shall be remitted to the department within 30 days after the date of the notification to the holder that the penalty is due and owing. As necessary for proper administration of this chapter, the department may waive any penalty due with appropriate justification. On written request by any person required to file a report and upon a showing of good cause, the department may postpone the reporting date. The department must provide information contained in a report filed with the department to any person requesting a copy of the report or information contained in a report, to the extent the information requested is not confidential, within 45 days after the report has been processed and added to the unclaimed property database subsequent to a determination that the report is accurate and that the reported property is the same as the remitted property.

(4)âHolders of inactive accounts having a value of $50 or more shall use due diligence to locate apparent owners. Not more than 120 days and not less than 60 days prior to filing the report required by this section, the holder in possession of property presumed unclaimed and subject to custody as unclaimed property under this chapter shall send written notice to the apparent owner at the apparent ownerâs last known address informing the apparent owner that the holder is in possession of property subject to this chapter, if the holder has in its records an address for the apparent owner which the holderâs records do not disclose to be inaccurate.

(5)âAny holder of intangible property may file with the department a petition for determination that the property is unclaimed requesting the department to accept custody of the property. The petition shall state any special circumstances that exist, contain the information required by subsection (2), and show that a diligent search has been made to locate the owner. If the department finds that the proof of diligent search is satisfactory, it shall give notice as provided in s. [717.118](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/717.118) and accept custody of the property.

(6)âUpon written request by any entity or person required to file a report, stating such entityâs or personâs justification for such action, the department may place that entity or person in an inactive status as an unclaimed property âholder.â

(7)(a)âThis section does not apply to the unclaimed patronage refunds as provided for by contract or through bylaw provisions of entities organized under chapter 425 or that are exempt from ad valorem taxation pursuant to s. [196.2002](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/196.2002).

(b)âThis section does not apply to intangible property held, issued, or owing by a business association subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Surface Transportation Board or its successor federal agency if the apparent owner of such intangible property is a business association.

(c)âThis section does not apply to credit balances, overpayments, refunds, or outstanding checks owed by a health care provider to a managed care payor with whom the health care provider has a managed care contract, provided that the credit balances, overpayments, refunds, or outstanding checks become due and owing pursuant to the managed care contract.

(8)(a)âAs used in this subsection, the term âproperty identifierâ means the descriptor used by the holder to identify the unclaimed property.

(b)âSocial security numbers and property identifiers contained in reports required under this section, held by the department, are confidential and exempt from s. [119.07](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/119.07)(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution.

Other means of notification, such as publication of the names of owners in the newspaper, on television, on the Internet, or through other promotional efforts and items in which the department does not directly attempt to contact the owner are expressly declared to be passive attempts. Nothing in this subsection precludes other agencies or entities of state government from notifying owners of the existence of unclaimed property or attempting to notify apparent owners of unclaimed property.

(2)âPayment of unclaimed funds may be made to the department by electronic funds transfer.

(3)âIf the owner establishes the right to receive the unclaimed property to the satisfaction of the holder before the property has been delivered to the department or it appears that for some other reason the presumption that the property is unclaimed is erroneous, the holder need not pay or deliver the property to the department. In lieu of delivery, the holder shall file a verified written explanation of the proof of claim or of the error in the presumption that the property was unclaimed.

(4)âAll stock or other intangible ownership interest reported under this chapter on the annual report filing required in s.

(a)âHolders may remit the value of cash and coins found in unclaimed safe-deposit boxes to the department by cashierâs check or by electronic funds transfer, unless the cash or coins have a value above face value. The department shall identify by rule those cash and coin items having a numismatic value. Cash and coin items identified as having a numismatic value shall be remitted to the department in their original form.

(b)âAny firearm or ammunition found in an unclaimed safe-deposit box or any other safekeeping repository shall be delivered by the holder to a law enforcement agency for disposal pursuant to s.

The penalty shall be $100 for a safe-deposit box shipment container that is late 30 days or less. Thereafter, the penalty shall be $500 for a safe-deposit box shipment container that is late for each additional successive 30-day period. The penalty assessed against a holder for a late safe-deposit box shipment container shall not exceed $4,000 annually. The penalty shall be remitted to the department within 30 days after the date of the notification to the holder that the penalty is due and owing.

(1)âUpon the payment or delivery of property to the department, the state assumes custody and responsibility for the safekeeping of property.

(2)âAny holder who has paid money to the department pursuant to this chapter may make payment to any person appearing to be entitled to payment and, upon filing proof that the payee is entitled thereto, the department shall forthwith repay the holder without deduction of any fee or other charges. If repayment is sought for a payment made on a negotiable instrument, including a travelerâs check or money order, the holder must be repaid under this subsection upon filing proof that the instrument was duly presented and that the payee is entitled to payment. The holder shall be repaid for payment made under this subsection even if the payment was made to a person whose claim was barred under s. [717.129](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/717.129)(1).

(3)âAny holder who has delivered property, including a certificate of any interest in a business association, other than money to the department pursuant to this chapter may reclaim the property if still in the possession of the department, without payment of any fee or other charges, upon filing proof that the owner has claimed the property from the holder.

(4)âThe department may accept an affidavit of the holder stating the facts that entitle the holder to recover money and property under this section as sufficient proof.

(5)âIf the holder pays or delivers property to the department in good faith and thereafter any other person claims the property from the holder paying or delivering, or another state claims the money or property under that stateâs laws relating to escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property, the department, upon written notice of the claim, shall defend the holder against the claim and indemnify the holder against any liability on the claim.

(6)âFor the purposes of this section, âgood faithâ means that:

(a)âPayment or delivery was made in a reasonable attempt to comply with this chapter.

(b)âThe person delivering the property was not a fiduciary then in breach of trust in respect to the property and had a reasonable basis for believing, based on the facts then known to that person, that the property was unclaimed for the purposes of this chapter.

(7)âProperty removed from a safe-deposit box or other safekeeping repository is received by the department subject to the holderâs right under this subsection to be reimbursed for the actual cost of the opening and to any valid lien or contract providing for the holder to be reimbursed for unpaid rent or storage charges.

(1)âExcept as provided in paragraph (2)(a), the department after the receipt of unclaimed property shall sell it to the highest bidder at public sale on the Internet or at a specified physical location wherever in the judgment of the department the most favorable market for the property involved exists. The department may decline the highest bid and reoffer the property for sale if in the judgment of the department the bid is insufficient. The department shall have the discretion to withhold from sale any unclaimed property that the department deems to be of benefit to the people of the state. If in the judgment of the department the probable cost of sale exceeds the value of the property, it need not be offered for sale and may be disposed of as the department determines appropriate. Any sale at a specified physical location held under this section must be preceded by a single publication of notice, at least 3 weeks in advance of sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the property is to be sold. The department shall proportionately deduct auction fees, preparation costs, and expenses from the amount posted to the ownerâs account when safe-deposit box contents are sold. No action or proceeding may be maintained against the department for or on account of any decision to decline the highest bid or withhold any unclaimed property from sale.

(2)(a)âSecurities listed on an established stock exchange must be sold at prices prevailing at the time of sale on the exchange. Other securities may be sold over the counter at prices prevailing at the time of sale or by any other method the department deems advisable. The department may authorize the agent or broker acting on behalf of the department to deduct fees from the proceeds of these sales at a rate agreed upon in advance by the agent or broker and the department. The department shall reimburse ownersâ accounts for these brokerage fees from the State School Fund unless the securities are sold at the ownerâs request.

(b)âUnless the department deems it to be in the public interest to do otherwise, all securities presumed unclaimed and delivered to the department may be sold upon receipt. Any person making a claim pursuant to this chapter is entitled to receive either the securities delivered to the department by the holder, if they still remain in the hands of the department, or the proceeds received from sale, but no person has any claim under this chapter against the state, the holder, any transfer agent, any registrar, or any other person acting for or on behalf of a holder for any appreciation in the value of the property occurring after delivery by the holder to the state.

(c)âCertificates for unclaimed stock or other equity interest of business associations that cannot be canceled and registered in the departmentâs name or that cannot be readily liquidated and converted into the currency of the United States may be sold for the value of the certificate, if any, in accordance with subsection (1) or may be destroyed in accordance with s.

(1)(a)âIf an unclaimed demand, savings, or checking account in a financial institution is reported as an âandâ account in the name of two or more persons who are not beneficiaries, it is presumed that each person must claim the account in order for the claim to be approved by the department.

(b)âIf an unclaimed demand, savings, or checking account in a financial institution is reported as an âandâ account and one of the persons on the account is deceased, it is presumed that the account is a survivorship account.

The person shall not be required to pay a per diem fee and expenses of an examination or investigation which shall consume more than 30 worker-days in any one year unless such examination or investigation is due to fraudulent practices of the person, in which case such person shall be required to pay the entire cost regardless of time consumed. The fee shall be remitted to the department within 30 days after the date of the notification that the fee is due and owing. Any person who fails to pay the fee within 30 days after the date of the notification that the fee is due and owing shall pay to the department interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum on such fee from the date of the notification.

3.âIf a person files a claim for one or more bonds and, after notice and hearing, the court determines that the claimant is entitled to the bonds claimed by such claimant, the court shall enter a judgment in favor of the claimant.

Source: [https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0718.104](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0718.104)

718.104âCreation of condominiums; contents of declaration.âEvery condominium created in this state shall be created pursuant to this chapter.

(1)âA condominium may be created on land owned in fee simple or held under a lease complying with the provisions of s. [718.401](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.401).

(2)âA condominium is created by recording a declaration in the public records of the county where the land is located, executed and acknowledged with the requirements for a deed. All persons who have record title to the interest in the land being submitted to condominium ownership, or their lawfully authorized agents, must join in the execution of the declaration. Upon the recording of the declaration, or an amendment adding a phase to the condominium under s. [718.403](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.403)(6), all units described in the declaration or phase amendment as being located in or on the land then being submitted to condominium ownership shall come into existence, regardless of the state of completion of planned improvements in which the units may be located or any other requirement or description that a declaration may provide. Upon recording the declaration of condominium pursuant to this section, the developer shall file the recording information with the division within 120 calendar days on a form prescribed by the division.

(3)âAll persons who have any record interest in any mortgage encumbering the interest in the land being submitted to condominium ownership must either join in the execution of the declaration or execute, with the requirements for deed, and record, a consent to the declaration or an agreement subordinating their mortgage interest to the declaration.

(4)âThe declaration must contain or provide for the following matters:

(a)âA statement submitting the property to condominium ownership.

(b)âThe name by which the condominium property is to be identified, which shall include the word âcondominiumâ or be followed by the words âa condominium.â

(c)âThe legal description of the land and, if a leasehold estate is submitted to condominium, an identification of the lease.

(d)âAn identification of each unit by letter, name, or number, or combination thereof, so that no unit bears the same designation as any other unit.

(e)âA survey of the land which meets the standards of practice established by the Board of Professional Surveyors and Mappers, pursuant to s. [472.027](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/472.027), and a graphic description of the improvements in which units are located and a plot plan thereof that, together with the declaration, are in sufficient detail to identify the common elements and each unit and their relative locations and approximate dimensions. Failure of the survey to meet the standards of practice does not invalidate an otherwise validly created condominium. The survey, graphic description, and plot plan may be in the form of exhibits consisting of building plans, floor plans, maps, surveys, or sketches. If the construction of the condominium is not substantially completed, there shall be a statement to that effect, and, upon substantial completion of construction, the developer or the association shall amend the declaration to include the certificate described below. The amendment may be accomplished by referring to the recording data of a survey of the condominium that complies with the certificate. A certificate of a surveyor and mapper authorized to practice in this state shall be included in or attached to the declaration or the survey or graphic description as recorded under s. [718.105](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.105) that the construction of the improvements is substantially complete so that the material, together with the provisions of the declaration describing the condominium property, is an accurate representation of the location and dimensions of the improvements and so that the identification, location, and dimensions of the common elements and of each unit can be determined from these materials. Completed units within each substantially completed building in a condominium development may be conveyed to purchasers, notwithstanding that other buildings in the condominium are not substantially completed, provided that all planned improvements, including, but not limited to, landscaping, utility services and access to the unit, and common-element facilities serving such building, as set forth in the declaration, are first completed and the declaration of condominium is first recorded and provided that as to the units being conveyed there is a certificate of a surveyor and mapper as required above, including certification that all planned improvements, including, but not limited to, landscaping, utility services and access to the unit, and common-element facilities serving the building in which the units to be conveyed are located have been substantially completed, and such certificate is recorded with the original declaration or as an amendment to such declaration. This section does not, however, operate to require development of improvements and amenities declared to be included in future phases pursuant to s. [718.403](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.403) before conveying a unit as provided in this paragraph. For the purposes of this section, a âcertificate of a surveyor and mapperâ means certification by a surveyor and mapper in the form provided in this paragraph and may include, along with certification by a surveyor and mapper, when appropriate, certification by an architect or engineer authorized to practice in this state. Notwithstanding the requirements of substantial completion provided in this section, this paragraph does not prohibit or impair the validity of a mortgage encumbering units together with an undivided interest in the common elements as described in a declaration of condominium recorded before the recording of a certificate of a surveyor and mapper as provided in this paragraph.

(f)âThe undivided share of ownership of the common elements and common surplus of the condominium that is appurtenant to each unit stated as a percentage or a fraction of the whole. In the declaration of condominium for residential condominiums created after April 1, 1992, the ownership share of the common elements assigned to each residential unit shall be based either upon the total square footage of each residential unit in uniform relationship to the total square footage of each other residential unit in the condominium or on an equal fractional basis.

(g)âThe percentage or fractional shares of liability for common expenses of the condominium, which, for all residential units, must be the same as the undivided shares of ownership of the common elements and common surplus appurtenant to each unit as provided for in paragraph (f).

(h)âIf a developer reserves the right, in a declaration recorded on or after July 1, 2000, to create a multicondominium, the declaration must state, or provide a specific formula for determining, the fractional or percentage shares of liability for the common expenses of the association and of ownership of the common surplus of the association to be allocated to the units in each condominium to be operated by the association. If a declaration recorded on or after July 1, 2000, for a condominium operated by a multicondominium association as originally recorded fails to so provide, the share of liability for the common expenses of the association and of ownership of the common surplus of the association allocated to each unit in each condominium operated by the association shall be a fraction of the whole, the numerator of which is the number âoneâ and the denominator of which is the total number of units in all condominiums operated by the association.

(i)âThe name of the association, which must be a corporation for profit or a corporation not for profit.

(j)âUnit ownersâ membership and voting rights in the association.

(k)âThe document or documents creating the association, which may be attached as an exhibit.

(l)âA copy of the bylaws, which shall be attached as an exhibit. Defects or omissions in the bylaws shall not affect the validity of the condominium or title to the condominium parcels.

(m)âOther desired provisions not inconsistent with this chapter.

(n)âThe creation of a nonexclusive easement for ingress and egress over streets, walks, and other rights-of-way serving the units of a condominium, as part of the common elements necessary to provide reasonable access to the public ways, or a dedication of the streets, walks, and other rights-of-way to the public. All easements for ingress and egress shall not be encumbered by any leasehold or lien other than those on the condominium parcels, unless:

1.âAny such lien is subordinate to the rights of unit owners, or

2.âThe holder of any encumbrance or leasehold of any easement has executed and recorded an agreement that the use-rights of each unit owner will not be terminated as long as the unit owner has not been evicted because of a default under the encumbrance or lease, and the use-rights of any mortgagee of a unit who has acquired title to a unit may not be terminated.

(o)âIf timeshare estates will or may be created with respect to any unit in the condominium, a statement in conspicuous type declaring that timeshare estates will or may be created with respect to units in the condominium. In addition, the degree, quantity, nature, and extent of the timeshare estates that will or may be created shall be defined and described in detail in the declaration, with a specific statement as to the minimum duration of the recurring periods of rights of use, possession, or occupancy that may be created with respect to any unit.

(5)âThe declaration as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein may include covenants and restrictions concerning the use, occupancy, and transfer of the units permitted by law with reference to real property. However, the rule against perpetuities shall not defeat a right given any person or entity by the declaration for the purpose of allowing unit owners to retain reasonable control over the use, occupancy, and transfer of units.

(6)âA person who joins in, or consents to the execution of, a declaration subjects his or her interest in the condominium property to the provisions of the declaration.

(7)âAll provisions of the declaration are enforceable equitable servitudes, run with the land, and are effective until the condominium is terminated.

(1)âA condominium parcel created by the declaration is a separate parcel of real property, even though the condominium is created on a leasehold.

(2)âThere shall pass with a unit, as appurtenances thereto:

(a)âAn undivided share in the common elements and common surplus.

(b)âThe exclusive right to use such portion of the common elements as may be provided by the declaration, including the right to transfer such right to other units or unit owners to the extent authorized by the declaration as originally recorded, or amendments to the declaration adopted pursuant to the provisions contained therein. Amendments to declarations of condominium providing for the transfer of use rights with respect to limited common elements are not amendments that materially modify unit appurtenances as described in s. [718.110](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.110)(4). However, in order to be effective, the transfer of use rights with respect to limited common elements must be effectuated in conformity with the procedures set forth in the declaration as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein. This section is intended to clarify existing law and applies to associations existing on the effective date of this act.

(c)âAn exclusive easement for the use of the airspace occupied by the unit as it exists at any particular time and as the unit may lawfully be altered or reconstructed from time to time. An easement in airspace which is vacated shall be terminated automatically.

(d)âMembership in the association designated in the declaration, with the full voting rights appertaining thereto.

(e)âOther appurtenances as may be provided in the declaration.

(3)âA unit owner is entitled to the exclusive possession of his or her unit, subject to the provisions of s. [718.111](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.111)(5). He or she is entitled to use the common elements in accordance with the purposes for which they are intended, but no use may hinder or encroach upon the lawful rights of other unit owners.

(4)âWhen a unit is leased, a tenant shall have all use rights in the association property and those common elements otherwise readily available for use generally by unit owners and the unit owner shall not have such rights except as a guest, unless such rights are waived in writing by the tenant. Nothing in this subsection shall interfere with the access rights of the unit owner as a landlord pursuant to chapter 83. The association shall have the right to adopt rules to prohibit dual usage by a unit owner and a tenant of association property and common elements otherwise readily available for use generally by unit owners.

(5)âA local government may not adopt an ordinance or regulation that prohibits condominium unit owners or their guests, licensees, or invitees from pedestrian access to a public beach contiguous to a condominium property, except where necessary to protect public health, safety, or natural resources. This subsection does not prohibit a governmental entity from enacting regulations governing activities taking place on the beach.

(2)âThe share in the common elements appurtenant to a unit cannot be conveyed or encumbered except together with the unit.

(3)âThe shares in the common elements appurtenant to units are undivided, and no action for partition of the common elements shall lie.

# Chapter 718 Section 1085 - 2023 Florida Statutes

Source: [https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0718.1085](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0718.1085)

Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 633 or of any other code, statute, ordinance, administrative rule, or regulation, or any interpretation thereof, an association, condominium, or unit owner is not obligated to retrofit the common elements or units of a residential condominium that meets the definition of âhousing for older personsâ in s. [760.29](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/760.29)(4)(b)3. to comply with requirements relating to handrails and guardrails if the unit owners have voted to forego such retrofitting by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all voting interests in the affected condominium. However, a condominium association may not vote to forego the retrofitting in common areas in a high-rise building. For the purposes of this section, the term âhigh-rise buildingâ means a building that is greater than 75 feet in height where the building height is measured from the lowest level of fire department access to the floor of the highest occupiable level. For the purposes of this section, the term âcommon areasâ means stairwells and exposed, outdoor walkways and corridors, but does not include individual balconies. In no event shall the local authority having jurisdiction require retrofitting of common areas with handrails and guardrails before the end of 2024.

(1)âA vote to forego retrofitting may not be obtained by general proxy or limited proxy, but shall be obtained by a vote personally cast at a duly called membership meeting, or by execution of a written consent by the member, and shall be effective upon the recording of a certificate attesting to such vote in the public records of the county where the condominium is located. The association shall provide each unit owner written notice of the vote to forego retrofitting of the required handrails or guardrails, or both, in at least 16-point bold type, by certified mail, within 20 days after the associationâs vote. After such notice is provided to each owner, a copy of such notice shall be provided by the current owner to a new owner prior to closing and shall be provided by a unit owner to a renter prior to signing a lease.

(2)âAs part of the information collected annually from condominiums, the division shall require condominium associations to report the membership vote and recording of a certificate under this subsection and, if retrofitting has been undertaken, the per-unit cost of such work. The division shall annually report to the Division of State Fire Marshal of the Department of Financial Services the number of condominiums that have elected to forego retrofitting.

718.110âAmendment of declaration; correction of error or omission in declaration by circuit court.â

(1)(a)âIf the declaration fails to provide a method of amendment, the declaration may be amended as to all matters except those described in subsection (4) or subsection (8) if the amendment is approved by the owners of not less than two-thirds of the units. Except as to those matters described in subsection (4) or subsection (8), no declaration recorded after April 1, 1992, shall require that amendments be approved by more than four-fifths of the voting interests.

(b)âNo provision of the declaration shall be revised or amended by reference to its title or number only. Proposals to amend existing provisions of the declaration shall contain the full text of the provision to be amended; new words shall be inserted in the text and underlined; and words to be deleted shall be lined through with hyphens. However, if the proposed change is so extensive that this procedure would hinder, rather than assist, the understanding of the proposed amendment, it is not necessary to use underlining and hyphens as indicators of words added or deleted, but, instead, a notation must be inserted immediately preceding the proposed amendment in substantially the following language: âSubstantial rewording of declaration. See provision Â  for present text.â

(c)âNonmaterial errors or omissions in the amendment process will not invalidate an otherwise properly promulgated amendment.

(2)âAn amendment, other than amendments made by the developer pursuant to ss. [718.104](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.104), [718.403](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.403), and [718.504](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.504)(6), (7), and (9) without a vote of the unit owners and any rights the developer may have in the declaration to amend without consent of the unit owners which shall be limited to matters other than those under subsections (4) and (8), shall be evidenced by a certificate of the association which shall include the recording data identifying the declaration and shall be executed in the form required for the execution of a deed. An amendment by the developer must be evidenced in writing, but a certificate of the association is not required. The developer of a timeshare condominium may reserve specific rights in the declaration to amend the declaration without the consent of the unit owners.

(3)âAn amendment of a declaration is effective when properly recorded in the public records of the county where the declaration is recorded.

(4)âUnless otherwise provided in the declaration as originally recorded, no amendment may change the configuration or size of any unit in any material fashion, materially alter or modify the appurtenances to the unit, or change the proportion or percentage by which the unit owner shares the common expenses of the condominium and owns the common surplus of the condominium unless the record owner of the unit and all record owners of liens on the unit join in the execution of the amendment and unless all the record owners of all other units in the same condominium approve the amendment. The acquisition of property by the association and material alterations or substantial additions to such property or the common elements by the association in accordance with s. [718.111](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.111)(7) or s. [718.113](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.113), and amendments providing for the transfer of use rights in limited common elements pursuant to s. [718.106](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.106)(2)(b) shall not be deemed to constitute a material alteration or modification of the appurtenances to the units. A declaration recorded after April 1, 1992, may not require the approval of less than a majority of total voting interests of the condominium for amendments under this subsection, unless otherwise required by a governmental entity.

(5)âIf it appears that through a scrivenerâs error a unit has not been designated as owning an appropriate undivided share of the common elements or does not bear an appropriate share of the common expenses or that all the common expenses or interest in the common surplus or all of the common elements in the condominium have not been distributed in the declaration, so that the sum total of the shares of common elements which have been distributed or the sum total of the shares of the common expenses or ownership of common surplus fails to equal 100 percent, or if it appears that more than 100 percent of common elements or common expenses or ownership of the common surplus have been distributed, the error may be corrected by filing an amendment to the declaration approved by the board of administration or a majority of the unit owners.

(6)âThe common elements designated by the declaration may be enlarged by an amendment to the declaration. The amendment must describe the interest in the property and must submit the property to the terms of the declaration. The amendment must be approved and executed as provided in this section. The amendment divests the association of title to the land and vests title in the unit owners as part of the common elements, without naming them and without further conveyance, in the same proportion as the undivided shares in the common elements that are appurtenant to the unit owned by them.

(7)âThe declarations, bylaws, and common elements of two or more independent condominiums of a single complex may be merged to form a single condominium, upon the approval of such voting interest of each condominium as is required by the declaration for modifying the appurtenances to the units or changing the proportion or percentages by which the owners of the parcel share the common expenses and own the common surplus; upon the approval of all record owners of liens; and upon the recording of new or amended articles of incorporation, declarations, and bylaws.

(8)âUnless otherwise provided in the declaration as originally recorded, no amendment to the declaration may permit timeshare estates to be created in any unit of the condominium, unless the record owner of each unit of the condominium and the record owners of liens on each unit of the condominium join in the execution of the amendment.

(9)âIf there is an omission or error in a declaration, or in any other document required by law to establish the condominium, the association may correct the error or omission by an amendment to the declaration or to the other document required to create a condominium in the manner provided in the declaration to amend the declaration or, if none is provided, by vote of a majority of the voting interests of the condominium. The amendment is effective when passed and approved and a certificate of amendment is executed and recorded as provided in subsections (2) and (3). This procedure for amendment cannot be used if such an amendment would materially or adversely affect property rights of unit owners, unless the affected unit owners consent in writing. This subsection does not restrict the powers of the association to otherwise amend the declaration, or other documentation, but authorizes a simple process of amendment requiring a lesser vote for the purpose of curing defects, errors, or omissions when the property rights of unit owners are not materially or adversely affected.

(10)âIf there is an omission or error in a declaration of condominium, or any other document required to establish the condominium, and the omission or error would affect the valid existence of the condominium, the circuit court may entertain a petition of one or more of the unit owners in the condominium, or of the association, to correct the error or omission, and the action may be a class action. The court may require that one or more methods of correcting the error or omission be submitted to the unit owners to determine the most acceptable correction. All unit owners, the association, and the mortgagees of a first mortgage of record must be joined as parties to the action. Service of process on unit owners may be by publication, but the plaintiff must furnish every unit owner not personally served with process with a copy of the petition and final decree of the court by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the unit ownerâs last known residence address. If an action to determine whether the declaration or another condominium document complies with the mandatory requirements for the formation of a condominium is not brought within 3 years of the recording of the certificate of a surveyor and mapper pursuant to s. [718.104](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.104)(4)(e) or the recording of an instrument that transfers title to a unit in the condominium which is not accompanied by a recorded assignment of developer rights in favor of the grantee of such unit, whichever occurs first, the declaration and other documents will effectively create a condominium, as of the date the declaration was recorded, regardless of whether the documents substantially comply with the mandatory requirements of law. However, both before and after the expiration of this 3-year period, the circuit court has jurisdiction to entertain a petition permitted under this subsection for the correction of the documentation, and other methods of amendment may be utilized to correct the errors or omissions at any time.

(11)âThe Legislature finds that the procurement of mortgagee consent to amendments that do not affect the rights or interests of mortgagees is an unreasonable and substantial logistical and financial burden on the unit owners and that there is a compelling state interest in enabling the members of a condominium association to approve amendments to the condominium documents through legal means. Accordingly, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this section:

(a)âAs to any mortgage recorded on or after October 1, 2007, any provision in the declaration, articles of incorporation, or bylaws that requires the consent or joinder of some or all mortgagees of units or any other portion of the condominium property to or in amendments to the declaration, articles of incorporation, or bylaws or for any other matter shall be enforceable only as to the following matters:

1.âThose matters described in subsections (4) and (8).

2.âAmendments to the declaration, articles of incorporation, or bylaws that adversely affect the priority of the mortgageeâs lien or the mortgageeâs rights to foreclose its lien or that otherwise materially affect the rights and interests of the mortgagees.

(b)âAs to mortgages recorded before October 1, 2007, any existing provisions in the declaration, articles of incorporation, or bylaws requiring mortgagee consent shall be enforceable.

(c)âIn securing consent or joinder, the association shall be entitled to rely upon the public records to identify the holders of outstanding mortgages. The association may use the address provided in the original recorded mortgage document, unless there is a different address for the holder of the mortgage in a recorded assignment or modification of the mortgage, which recorded assignment or modification must reference the official records book and page on which the original mortgage was recorded. Once the association has identified the recorded mortgages of record, the association shall, in writing, request of each unit owner whose unit is encumbered by a mortgage of record any information the owner has in his or her possession regarding the name and address of the person to whom mortgage payments are currently being made. Notice shall be sent to such person if the address provided in the original recorded mortgage document is different from the name and address of the mortgagee or assignee of the mortgage as shown by the public record. The association shall be deemed to have complied with this requirement by making the written request of the unit owners required under this paragraph. Any notices required to be sent to the mortgagees under this paragraph shall be sent to all available addresses provided to the association.

(d)âAny notice to the mortgagees required under paragraph (c) may be sent by a method that establishes proof of delivery, and any mortgagee who fails to respond within 60 days after the date of mailing shall be deemed to have consented to the amendment.

(e)âFor those amendments requiring mortgagee consent on or after October 1, 2007, in the event mortgagee consent is provided other than by properly recorded joinder, such consent shall be evidenced by affidavit of the association recorded in the public records of the county where the declaration is recorded. Any amendment adopted without the required consent of a mortgagee shall be voidable only by a mortgagee who was entitled to notice and an opportunity to consent. An action to void an amendment shall be subject to the statute of limitations beginning 5 years after the date of discovery as to the amendments described in subparagraphs (a)1. and 2. and 5 years after the date of recordation of the certificate of amendment for all other amendments. This provision shall apply to all mortgages, regardless of the date of recordation of the mortgage.

(f)âNotwithstanding the provisions of this section, any amendment or amendments to conform a declaration of condominium to the insurance coverage provisions in s. [718.111](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.111)(11) may be made as provided in that section.

(12)(a)âWith respect to an existing multicondominium association, any amendment to change the fractional or percentage share of liability for the common expenses of the association and ownership of the common surplus of the association must be approved by at least a majority of the total voting interests of each condominium operated by the association unless the declarations of all condominiums operated by the association uniformly require approval by a greater percentage of the voting interests of each condominium.

(b)âUnless approval by a greater percentage of the voting interests of an existing multicondominium association is expressly required in the declaration of an existing condominium, the declaration may be amended upon approval of at least a majority of the total voting interests of each condominium operated by the multicondominium association for the purpose of:

1.âSetting forth in the declaration the formula currently utilized, but not previously stated in the declaration, for determining the percentage or fractional shares of liability for the common expenses of the multicondominium association and ownership of the common surplus of the multicondominium association.

2.âProviding for the creation or enlargement of a multicondominium association by the merger or consolidation of two or more associations and changing the name of the association, as appropriate.

(13)âAn amendment prohibiting unit owners from renting their units or altering the duration of the rental term or specifying or limiting the number of times unit owners are entitled to rent their units during a specified period applies only to unit owners who consent to the amendment and unit owners who acquire title to their units after the effective date of that amendment.

(14)âExcept for those portions of the common elements designed and intended to be used by all unit owners, a portion of the common elements serving only one unit or a group of units may be reclassified as a limited common element upon the vote required to amend the declaration as provided therein or as required under paragraph (1)(a), and shall not be considered an amendment pursuant to subsection (4). This is a clarification of existing law.

(1)âIf an association fails to fill vacancies on the board of administration sufficient to constitute a quorum in accordance with the bylaws, any unit owner may give notice of his or her intent to apply to the circuit court within whose jurisdiction the condominium lies for the appointment of a receiver to manage the affairs of the association. The form of the notice shall be as follows:

NOTICE OF INTENT TO\
APPLY FOR RECEIVERSHIP

YOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED that the undersigned owner of a condominium unit in Â Â (name of condominium)Â Â  intends to file a petition in the circuit court for appointment of a receiver to manage the affairs of the association on the grounds that the association has failed to fill vacancies on the board of administration sufficient to constitute a quorum. This petition will not be filed if the vacancies are filled within 30 days after the date on which this notice was sent or posted, whichever is later. If a receiver is appointed, the receiver shall have all of the powers of the board and shall be entitled to receive a salary and reimbursement of all costs and attorneyâs fees payable from association funds.

The notice must be posted and mailed or delivered at least 30 days prior to the filing of a petition seeking receivership. Notice by mail to a unit owner shall be sent to the address used by the county property appraiser for notice to the unit owner, except that where a unit ownerâs address is not publicly available the notice shall be mailed to the unit.

(3)âIf the association fails to fill the vacancies within 30 days after the notice required by subsection (1) is posted and mailed or delivered, the unit owner may proceed with the petition.

(4)âIf a receiver is appointed, all unit owners shall be given written notice of such appointment as provided in s. [718.127](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.127).

(5)âThe association shall be responsible for the salary of the receiver, court costs, and attorneyâs fees.

718.113âMaintenance; limitation upon improvement; display of flag; hurricane shutters and protection; display of religious decorations.â

(1)âMaintenance of the common elements is the responsibility of the association, except for any maintenance responsibility for limited common elements assigned to the unit owner by the declaration. The association shall provide for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of the condominium property for which it bears responsibility pursuant to the declaration of condominium. After turnover of control of the association to the unit owners, the association must perform any required maintenance identified by the developer pursuant to s. [718.301](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.301)(4)(p) and (q) until the association obtains new maintenance protocols from a licensed professional engineer or architect or a person certified as a reserve specialist or professional reserve analyst by the Community Associations Institute or the Association of Professional Reserve Analysts. The declaration may provide that certain limited common elements shall be maintained by those entitled to use the limited common elements or that the association shall provide the maintenance, either as a common expense or with the cost shared only by those entitled to use the limited common elements. If the maintenance is to be by the association at the expense of only those entitled to use the limited common elements, the declaration shall describe in detail the method of apportioning such costs among those entitled to use the limited common elements, and the association may use the provisions of s. [718.116](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.116) to enforce payment of the shares of such costs by the unit owners entitled to use the limited common elements.

(2)(a)âExcept as otherwise provided in this section, there shall be no material alteration or substantial additions to the common elements or to real property which is association property, except in a manner provided in the declaration as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein. If the declaration as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein does not specify the procedure for approval of material alterations or substantial additions, 75 percent of the total voting interests of the association must approve the alterations or additions before the material alterations or substantial additions are commenced. This paragraph is intended to clarify existing law and applies to associations existing on July 1, 2018.

(b)âThere shall not be any material alteration of, or substantial addition to, the common elements of any condominium operated by a multicondominium association unless approved in the manner provided in the declaration of the affected condominium or condominiums as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein. If a declaration as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein does not specify a procedure for approving such an alteration or addition, the approval of 75 percent of the total voting interests of each affected condominium is required before the material alterations or substantial additions are commenced. This subsection does not prohibit a provision in any declaration, articles of incorporation, or bylaws as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein requiring the approval of unit owners in any condominium operated by the same association or requiring board approval before a material alteration or substantial addition to the common elements is permitted. This paragraph is intended to clarify existing law and applies to associations existing on July 1, 2018.

(c)âThere shall not be any material alteration or substantial addition made to association real property operated by a multicondominium association, except as provided in the declaration, articles of incorporation, or bylaws as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein. If the declaration, articles of incorporation, or bylaws as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein do not specify the procedure for approving an alteration or addition to association real property, the approval of 75 percent of the total voting interests of the association is required before the material alterations or substantial additions are commenced. This paragraph is intended to clarify existing law and applies to associations existing on July 1, 2018.

(3)âA unit owner shall not do anything within his or her unit or on the common elements which would adversely affect the safety or soundness of the common elements or any portion of the association property or condominium property which is to be maintained by the association.

(4)âAny unit owner may display one portable, removable United States flag in a respectful way and, on Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day, Patriot Day, and Veterans Day, may display in a respectful way portable, removable official flags, not larger than 4 1/2 feet by 6 feet, that represent the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, or Coast Guard, regardless of any declaration rules or requirements dealing with flags or decorations.

(5)âEach board of administration of a residential condominium shall adopt hurricane shutter specifications for each building within each condominium operated by the association which shall include color, style, and other factors deemed relevant by the board. All specifications adopted by the board must comply with the applicable building code.

(a)âThe board may, subject to s. [718.3026](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.3026) and the approval of a majority of voting interests of the residential condominium, install hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection that comply with or exceed the applicable building code. However, a vote of the owners is not required if the maintenance, repair, and replacement of hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection are the responsibility of the association pursuant to the declaration of condominium. If hurricane protection or laminated glass or window film architecturally designed to function as hurricane protection that complies with or exceeds the current applicable building code has been previously installed, the board may not install hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection except upon approval by a majority vote of the voting interests.

(b)âThe association is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of the hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection authorized by this subsection if such property is the responsibility of the association pursuant to the declaration of condominium. If the hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection are the responsibility of the unit owners pursuant to the declaration of condominium, the maintenance, repair, and replacement of such items are the responsibility of the unit owner.

(c)âThe board may operate shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection installed pursuant to this subsection without permission of the unit owners only if such operation is necessary to preserve and protect the condominium property and association property. The installation, replacement, operation, repair, and maintenance of such shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph are not a material alteration to the common elements or association property within the meaning of this section.

(d)âNotwithstanding any other provision in the residential condominium documents, if approval is required by the documents, a board may not refuse to approve the installation or replacement of hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection by a unit owner conforming to the specifications adopted by the board.

(6)âAn association may not refuse the request of a unit owner for a reasonable accommodation for the attachment on the mantel or frame of the door of the unit owner of a religious object not to exceed 3 inches wide, 6 inches high, and 1.5 inches deep.

(7)âNotwithstanding the provisions of this section or the governing documents of a condominium or a multicondominium association, the board of administration may, without any requirement for approval of the unit owners, install upon or within the common elements or association property solar collectors, clotheslines, or other energy-efficient devices based on renewable resources for the benefit of the unit owners.

(8)âThe Legislature finds that the use of electric and natural gas fuel vehicles conserves and protects the stateâs environmental resources, provides significant economic savings to drivers, and serves an important public interest. The participation of condominium associations is essential to the stateâs efforts to conserve and protect the stateâs environmental resources and provide economic savings to drivers. For purposes of this subsection, the term ânatural gas fuelâ has the same meaning as in s. [206.9951](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/206.9951), and the term ânatural gas fuel vehicleâ means any motor vehicle, as defined in s. [320.01](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.01), that is powered by natural gas fuel. Therefore, the installation of an electric vehicle charging station or a natural gas fuel station shall be governed as follows:

(a)âA declaration of condominium or restrictive covenant may not prohibit or be enforced so as to prohibit any unit owner from installing an electric vehicle charging station or a natural gas fuel station within the boundaries of the unit ownerâs limited common element or exclusively designated parking area. The board of administration of a condominium association may not prohibit a unit owner from installing an electric vehicle charging station for an electric vehicle, as defined in s. [320.01](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.01), or a natural gas fuel station for a natural gas fuel vehicle within the boundaries of his or her limited common element or exclusively designated parking area. The installation of such charging or fuel stations is subject to the provisions of this subsection.

(b)âThe installation may not cause irreparable damage to the condominium property.

(c)âThe electricity for the electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station must be separately metered or metered by an embedded meter and payable by the unit owner installing such charging or fuel station or by his or her successor.

(d)âThe cost for supply and storage of the natural gas fuel must be paid by the unit owner installing the natural gas fuel station or by his or her successor.

(e)âThe unit owner who is installing an electric vehicle charging station or a natural gas fuel station is responsible for the costs of installation, operation, maintenance, and repair, including, but not limited to, hazard and liability insurance. The association may enforce payment of such costs under s. [718.116](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.116).

(f)âIf the unit owner or his or her successor decides there is no longer a need for the electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station, such person is responsible for the cost of removal of such charging or fuel station. The association may enforce payment of such costs under s. [718.116](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.116).

(g)âThe unit owner installing, maintaining, or removing the electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station is responsible for complying with all federal, state, or local laws and regulations applicable to such installation, maintenance, or removal.

(h)âThe association may require the unit owner to:

1.âComply with bona fide safety requirements, consistent with applicable building codes or recognized safety standards, for the protection of persons and property.

2.âComply with reasonable architectural standards adopted by the association that govern the dimensions, placement, or external appearance of the electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station, provided that such standards may not prohibit the installation of such charging or fuel station or substantially increase the cost thereof.

3.âEngage the services of a licensed and registered firm familiar with the installation or removal and core requirements of an electric vehicle charging station or a natural gas fuel station.

4.âProvide a certificate of insurance naming the association as an additional insured on the ownerâs insurance policy for any claim related to the installation, maintenance, or use of the electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station within 14 days after receiving the associationâs approval to install such charging or fuel station or notice to provide such a certificate.

5.âReimburse the association for the actual cost of any increased insurance premium amount attributable to the electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station within 14 days after receiving the associationâs insurance premium invoice.

(i)âThe association provides an implied easement across the common elements of the condominium property to the unit owner for purposes of electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station installation, and the furnishing of electrical power or natural gas fuel supply, including any necessary equipment, to such charging or fuel station, subject to the requirements of this subsection.

(9)âThe board of administration of an association may make available, install, or operate an electric vehicle charging station or a natural gas fuel station upon the common elements or association property and establish the charges or the manner of payments for the unit owners, residents, or guests who use the electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station. For the purposes of this section, the installation, repair, or maintenance of an electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station under this subsection does not constitute a material alteration or substantial addition to the common elements or association property.

718.115âCommon expenses and common surplus.â

(1)(a)âCommon expenses include the expenses of the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, or protection of the common elements and association property, costs of carrying out the powers and duties of the association, and any other expense, whether or not included in the foregoing, designated as common expense by this chapter, the declaration, the documents creating the association, or the bylaws. Common expenses also include reasonable transportation services, insurance for directors and officers, road maintenance and operation expenses, in-house communications, and security services, which are reasonably related to the general benefit of the unit owners even if such expenses do not attach to the common elements or property of the condominium. However, such common expenses must either have been services or items provided on or after the date control of the association is transferred from the developer to the unit owners or must be services or items provided for in the condominium documents or bylaws. Unless the manner of payment or allocation of expenses is otherwise addressed in the declaration of condominium, the expenses of any items or services required by any federal, state, or local governmental entity to be installed, maintained, or supplied to the condominium property by the association, including, but not limited to, firesafety equipment or water and sewer service where a master meter serves the condominium, shall be common expenses whether or not such items or services are specifically identified as common expenses in the declaration of condominium, articles of incorporation, or bylaws of the association.

(b)âThe common expenses of a condominium within a multicondominium are the common expenses directly attributable to the operation of that condominium. The common expenses of a multicondominium association do not include the common expenses directly attributable to the operation of any specific condominium or condominiums within the multicondominium. This paragraph is intended to clarify existing law and applies to associations existing on the effective date of this act.

(c)âThe common expenses of a multicondominium association may include categories of expenses related to the property or common elements within a specific condominium in the multicondominium if such property or common elements are areas in which all members of the multicondominium association have use rights or from which all members receive tangible economic benefits. Such common expenses of the association shall be identified in the declaration or bylaws as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein of each condominium within the multicondominium association. This paragraph is intended to clarify existing law and applies to associations existing on the effective date of this act.

(d)âIf provided in the declaration, the cost of communications services as defined in chapter 202, information services, or Internet services obtained pursuant to a bulk contract is a common expense. If the declaration does not provide for the cost of such services as a common expense, the board may enter into such a contract, and the cost of the service will be a common expense. The cost for the services under a bulk rate contract may be allocated on a per-unit basis rather than a percentage basis if the declaration provides for other than an equal sharing of common expenses, and any contract entered into before July 1, 1998, in which the cost of the service is not equally divided among all unit owners, may be changed by vote of a majority of the voting interests present at a regular or special meeting of the association, to allocate the cost equally among all units. The contract must be for at least 2 years.

1.âAny contract made by the board on or after July 1, 1998, may be canceled by a majority of the voting interests present at the next regular or special meeting of the association. Any member may make a motion to cancel the contract, but if no motion is made or if such motion fails to obtain the required majority at the next regular or special meeting, whichever occurs first, following the making of the contract, such contract shall be deemed ratified for the term therein expressed.

2.âSuch contract must provide, and is deemed to provide if not expressly set forth, that any hearing-impaired or legally blind unit owner who does not occupy the unit with a non-hearing-impaired or sighted person, or any unit owner receiving supplemental security income under Title XVI of the Social Security Act or food assistance as administered by the Department of Children and Families pursuant to s. [414.31](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/414.31), may discontinue the cable or video service without incurring disconnect fees, penalties, or subsequent service charges, and, as to such units, the owners are not required to pay any common expenses charge related to such service. If fewer than all members of an association share the expenses of cable or video service, the expense shall be shared equally by all participating unit owners. The association may use the provisions of s. [718.116](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.116) to enforce payment of the shares of such costs by the unit owners receiving cable or video service.

(e)âThe expense of installation, replacement, operation, repair, and maintenance of hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection by the board pursuant to s. [718.113](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.113)(5) constitutes a common expense and shall be collected as provided in this section if the association is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of the hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection pursuant to the declaration of condominium. However, if the maintenance, repair, and replacement of the hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection are the responsibility of the unit owners pursuant to the declaration of condominium, the cost of the installation of the hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection is not a common expense and shall be charged individually to the unit owners based on the cost of installation of the hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection appurtenant to the unit. Notwithstanding s. [718.116](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.116)(9), and regardless of whether or not the declaration requires the association or unit owners to maintain, repair, or replace hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection, a unit owner who has previously installed hurricane shutters in accordance with s. [718.113](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.113)(5) that comply with the current applicable building code shall receive a credit when the shutters are installed; a unit owner who has previously installed impact glass or code-compliant windows or doors that comply with the current applicable building code shall receive a credit when the impact glass or code-compliant windows or doors are installed; and a unit owner who has installed other types of code-compliant hurricane protection that comply with the current applicable building code shall receive a credit when the same type of other code-compliant hurricane protection is installed, and the credit shall be equal to the pro rata portion of the assessed installation cost assigned to each unit. However, such unit owner remains responsible for the pro rata share of expenses for hurricane shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection installed on common elements and association property by the board pursuant to s. [718.113](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.113)(5) and remains responsible for a pro rata share of the expense of the replacement, operation, repair, and maintenance of such shutters, impact glass, code-compliant windows or doors, or other types of code-compliant hurricane protection.

(f)âCommon expenses include the costs of insurance acquired by the association under the authority of s. [718.111](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.111)(11), including costs and contingent expenses required to participate in a self-insurance fund authorized and approved pursuant to s. [624.462](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/624.462).

(g)âIf any unpaid share of common expenses or assessments is extinguished by foreclosure of a superior lien or by a deed in lieu of foreclosure thereof, the unpaid share of common expenses or assessments are common expenses collectible from all the unit owners in the condominium in which the unit is located.

(2)âExcept as otherwise provided by this chapter, funds for payment of the common expenses of a condominium shall be collected by assessments against the units in that condominium in the proportions or percentages provided in that condominiumâs declaration. In a residential condominium, or mixed-use condominium created after January 1, 1996, each unitâs share of the common expenses of the condominium and common surplus of the condominium shall be the same as the unitâs appurtenant ownership interest in the common elements.

(3)âCommon surplus is owned by unit owners in the same shares as their ownership interest in the common elements.

(4)(a)âFunds for payment of the common expenses of a condominium within a multicondominium shall be collected as provided in subsection (2). Common expenses of a multicondominium association shall be funded by assessments against all unit owners in the association in the proportion or percentage set forth in the declaration as required by s. [718.104](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.104)(4)(h) or s. [718.110](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.110)(12), as applicable.

(b)âIn a multicondominium association, the total common surplus owned by a unit owner consists of that ownerâs share of the common surplus of the association plus that ownerâs share of the common surplus of the condominium in which the ownerâs unit is located, in the proportion or percentage set forth in the declaration as required by s. [718.104](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.104)(4)(h) or s. [718.110](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.110)(12), as applicable.

718.116âAssessments; liability; lien and priority; interest; collection.â

(1)(a)âA unit owner, regardless of how his or her title has been acquired, including by purchase at a foreclosure sale or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, is liable for all assessments which come due while he or she is the unit owner. Additionally, a unit owner is jointly and severally liable with the previous owner for all unpaid assessments that came due up to the time of transfer of title. This liability is without prejudice to any right the owner may have to recover from the previous owner the amounts paid by the owner. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term âprevious ownerâ does not include an association that acquires title to a delinquent property through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure. A present unit ownerâs liability for unpaid assessments is limited to any unpaid assessments that accrued before the association acquired title to the delinquent property through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure.

(b)1.âThe liability of a first mortgagee or its successor or assignees who acquire title to a unit by foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure for the unpaid assessments that became due before the mortgageeâs acquisition of title is limited to the lesser of:

a.âThe unitâs unpaid common expenses and regular periodic assessments which accrued or came due during the 12 months immediately preceding the acquisition of title and for which payment in full has not been received by the association; or

b.âOne percent of the original mortgage debt. The provisions of this paragraph apply only if the first mortgagee joined the association as a defendant in the foreclosure action. Joinder of the association is not required if, on the date the complaint is filed, the association was dissolved or did not maintain an office or agent for service of process at a location which was known to or reasonably discoverable by the mortgagee.

2.âAn association, or its successor or assignee, that acquires title to a unit through the foreclosure of its lien for assessments is not liable for any unpaid assessments, late fees, interest, or reasonable attorneyâs fees and costs that came due before the associationâs acquisition of title in favor of any other association, as defined in s. [718.103](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.103) or s. [720.301](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.301)(9), which holds a superior lien interest on the unit. This subparagraph is intended to clarify existing law.

(c)âThe person acquiring title shall pay the amount owed to the association within 30 days after transfer of title. Failure to pay the full amount when due shall entitle the association to record a claim of lien against the parcel and proceed in the same manner as provided in this section for the collection of unpaid assessments.

(d)âWith respect to each timeshare unit, each owner of a timeshare estate therein is jointly and severally liable for the payment of all assessments and other charges levied against or with respect to that unit pursuant to the declaration or bylaws, except to the extent that the declaration or bylaws may provide to the contrary.

(e)âNotwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b), a first mortgagee or its successor or assignees who acquire title to a condominium unit as a result of the foreclosure of the mortgage or by deed in lieu of foreclosure of the mortgage shall be exempt from liability for all unpaid assessments attributable to the parcel or chargeable to the previous owner which came due prior to acquisition of title if the first mortgage was recorded prior to April 1, 1992. If, however, the first mortgage was recorded on or after April 1, 1992, or on the date the mortgage was recorded, the declaration included language incorporating by reference future amendments to this chapter, the provisions of paragraph (b) shall apply.

(f)âThe provisions of this subsection are intended to clarify existing law, and shall not be available in any case where the unpaid assessments sought to be recovered by the association are secured by a lien recorded prior to the recording of the mortgage. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 48, the association shall be a proper party to intervene in any foreclosure proceeding to seek equitable relief.

(g)âFor purposes of this subsection, the term âsuccessor or assigneeâ as used with respect to a first mortgagee includes only a subsequent holder of the first mortgage.

(2)âThe liability for assessments may not be avoided by waiver of the use or enjoyment of any common element or by abandonment of the unit for which the assessments are made.

(3)âAssessments and installments on assessments which are not paid when due bear interest at the rate provided in the declaration, from the due date until paid. The rate may not exceed the rate allowed by law, and, if no rate is provided in the declaration, interest accrues at the rate of 18 percent per year. If provided by the declaration or bylaws, the association may, in addition to such interest, charge an administrative late fee of up to the greater of $25 or 5 percent of each delinquent installment for which the payment is late. Any payment received by an association must be applied first to any interest accrued by the association, then to any administrative late fee, then to any costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in collection, and then to the delinquent assessment. The foregoing is applicable notwithstanding s. [673.3111](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/673.3111), any purported accord and satisfaction, or any restrictive endorsement, designation, or instruction placed on or accompanying a payment. The preceding sentence is intended to clarify existing law. A late fee is not subject to chapter 687 or s. [718.303](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.303)(4).

(4)âIf the association is authorized by the declaration or bylaws to approve or disapprove a proposed lease of a unit, the grounds for disapproval may include, but are not limited to, a unit owner being delinquent in the payment of an assessment at the time approval is sought.

(5)(a)âThe association has a lien on each condominium parcel to secure the payment of assessments. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (1) and as set forth below, the lien is effective from and shall relate back to the recording of the original declaration of condominium, or, in the case of lien on a parcel located in a phase condominium, the last to occur of the recording of the original declaration or amendment thereto creating the parcel. However, as to first mortgages of record, the lien is effective from and after recording of a claim of lien in the public records of the county in which the condominium parcel is located. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to bestow upon any lien, mortgage, or certified judgment of record on April 1, 1992, including the lien for unpaid assessments created herein, a priority which, by law, the lien, mortgage, or judgment did not have before that date.

(b)âTo be valid, a claim of lien must state the description of the condominium parcel, the name of the record owner, the name and address of the association, the amount due, and the due dates. It must be executed and acknowledged by an officer or authorized agent of the association. The lien is not effective 1 year after the claim of lien was recorded unless, within that time, an action to enforce the lien is commenced. The 1-year period is automatically extended for any length of time during which the association is prevented from filing a foreclosure action by an automatic stay resulting from a bankruptcy petition filed by the parcel owner or any other person claiming an interest in the parcel. The claim of lien secures all unpaid assessments that are due and that may accrue after the claim of lien is recorded and through the entry of a final judgment, as well as interest, administrative late fees, and all reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred by the association incident to the collection process. Upon payment in full, the person making the payment is entitled to a satisfaction of the lien.

(c)âBy recording a notice in substantially the following form, a unit owner or the unit ownerâs agent or attorney may require the association to enforce a recorded claim of lien against his or her condominium parcel:

NOTICE OF CONTEST OF LIEN

TO: Â Â (Name and address of association)Â Â  You are notified that the undersigned contests the claim of lien filed by you on Â , Â Â (year)Â Â , and recorded in Official Records Book Â  at Page Â , of the public records of Â  County, Florida, and that the time within which you may file suit to enforce your lien is limited to 90 days from the date of service of this notice. Executed this Â  day of Â , Â Â (year)Â Â .

Signed: Â Â (Owner or Attorney)Â Â 

After notice of contest of lien has been recorded, the clerk of the circuit court shall mail a copy of the recorded notice to the association by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the address shown in the claim of lien or most recent amendment to it and shall certify to the service on the face of the notice. Service is complete upon mailing. After service, the association has 90 days in which to file an action to enforce the lien; and, if the action is not filed within the 90-day period, the lien is void. However, the 90-day period shall be extended for any length of time during which the association is prevented from filing its action because of an automatic stay resulting from the filing of a bankruptcy petition by the unit owner or by any other person claiming an interest in the parcel.

(d)âA release of lien must be in substantially the following form:

RELEASE OF LIEN

The undersigned lienor, in consideration of the final payment in the amount of $Â , hereby waives and releases its lien and right to claim a lien for unpaid assessments through Â , Â Â (year)Â Â , recorded in the Official Records Book Â  at Page Â , of the public records of Â  County, Florida, for the following described real property:

UNIT NO. Â  OF Â Â (NAME OF CONDOMINIUM)Â Â , A CONDOMINIUM AS SET FORTH IN THE DECLARATION OF CONDOMINIUM AND THE EXHIBITS ANNEXED THERETO AND FORMING A PART THEREOF, RECORDED IN OFFICIAL RECORDS BOOK Â , PAGE Â , OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS OF Â  COUNTY, FLORIDA. THE ABOVE DESCRIPTION INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ALL APPURTENANCES TO THE CONDOMINIUM UNIT ABOVE DESCRIBED, INCLUDING THE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE COMMON ELEMENTS OF SAID CONDOMINIUM.

Â Â (Signature of Authorized Agent)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Signature of Witness)Â Â 

Â Â (Print Name)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Print Name)Â Â 

Â Â (Signature of Witness)Â Â 

Â Â (Print Name)Â Â 

Sworn to (or affirmed) and subscribed before me this Â  day of Â , Â Â (year)Â Â , by Â Â (name of person making statement)Â Â .

Â Â (Signature of Notary Public)Â Â 

Â Â (Print, type, or stamp commissioned name of Notary Public)Â Â 

Personally KnownÂ  OR ProducedÂ  as identification.

(6)(a)âThe association may bring an action in its name to foreclose a lien for assessments in the manner a mortgage of real property is foreclosed and may also bring an action to recover a money judgment for the unpaid assessments without waiving any claim of lien. The association is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneyâs fees incurred in either a lien foreclosure action or an action to recover a money judgment for unpaid assessments.

(b)âNo foreclosure judgment may be entered until at least 45 days after the association gives written notice to the unit owner of its intention to foreclose its lien to collect the unpaid assessments. The notice must be in substantially the following form:

DELINQUENT ASSESSMENT

This letter is to inform you a Claim of Lien has been filed against your property because you have not paid the Â Â (type of assessment)Â Â  assessment to Â Â (name of association)Â Â . The association intends to foreclose the lien and collect the unpaid amount within 45 days of this letter being provided to you.

You owe the interest accruing from Â Â (month/year)Â Â  to the present. As of the date of this letter, the total amount due with interest is $Â . All costs of any action and interest from this day forward will also be charged to your account.

Any questions concerning this matter should be directed to Â Â (insert name, addresses, and telephone numbers of association representative)Â Â .

If this notice is not given at least 45 days before the foreclosure action is filed, and if the unpaid assessments, including those coming due after the claim of lien is recorded, are paid before the entry of a final judgment of foreclosure, the association shall not recover attorney fees or costs. The notice must be given by delivery of a copy of it to the unit owner or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the unit owner at his or her last known address; and, upon such mailing, the notice shall be deemed to have been given, and the court shall proceed with the foreclosure action and may award attorney fees and costs as permitted by law. The notice requirements of this subsection are satisfied if the unit owner records a notice of contest of lien as provided in subsection (5). The notice requirements of this subsection do not apply if an action to foreclose a mortgage on the condominium unit is pending before any court; if the rights of the association would be affected by such foreclosure; and if actual, constructive, or substitute service of process has been made on the unit owner.

(c)âIf the unit owner remains in possession of the unit after a foreclosure judgment has been entered, the court, in its discretion, may require the unit owner to pay a reasonable rental for the unit. If the unit is rented or leased during the pendency of the foreclosure action, the association is entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect the rent. The expenses of the receiver shall be paid by the party which does not prevail in the foreclosure action.

(d)âThe association has the power to purchase the condominium parcel at the foreclosure sale and to hold, lease, mortgage, or convey it.

(7)âA first mortgagee acquiring title to a condominium parcel as a result of foreclosure, or a deed in lieu of foreclosure, may not, during the period of its ownership of such parcel, whether or not such parcel is unoccupied, be excused from the payment of some or all of the common expenses coming due during the period of such ownership.

(8)âWithin 10 business days after receiving a written or electronic request therefor from a unit owner or the unit ownerâs designee, or a unit mortgagee or the unit mortgageeâs designee, the association shall issue the estoppel certificate. Each association shall designate on its website a person or entity with a street or e-mail address for receipt of a request for an estoppel certificate issued pursuant to this section. The estoppel certificate must be provided by hand delivery, regular mail, or e-mail to the requestor on the date of issuance of the estoppel certificate.

(a)âAn estoppel certificate may be completed by any board member, authorized agent, or authorized representative of the association, including any authorized agent, authorized representative, or employee of a management company authorized to complete this form on behalf of the board or association.

(e)âA summary proceeding pursuant to s. [51.011](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/51.011) may be brought to compel compliance with this subsection, and in any such action the prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees.

(f)âNotwithstanding any limitation on transfer fees contained in s. [718.112](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.112)(2)(k), an association or its authorized agent may charge a reasonable fee for the preparation and delivery of an estoppel certificate, which may not exceed $250, if, on the date the certificate is issued, no delinquent amounts are owed to the association for the applicable unit. If an estoppel certificate is requested on an expedited basis and delivered within 3 business days after the request, the association may charge an additional fee of $100. If a delinquent amount is owed to the association for the applicable unit, an additional fee for the estoppel certificate may not exceed $150.

(g)âIf estoppel certificates for multiple units owned by the same owner are simultaneously requested from the same association and there are no past due monetary obligations owed to the association, the statement of moneys due for those units may be delivered in one or more estoppel certificates, and, even though the fee for each unit shall be computed as set forth in paragraph (f), the total fee that the association may charge for the preparation and delivery of the estoppel certificates may not exceed, in the aggregate:

1.âFor 25 or fewer units, $750.

2.âFor 26 to 50 units, $1,000.

3.âFor 51 to 100 units, $1,500.

4.âFor more than 100 units, $2,500.

(h)âThe authority to charge a fee for the preparation and delivery of the estoppel certificate must be established by a written resolution adopted by the board or provided by a written management, bookkeeping, or maintenance contract and is payable upon the preparation of the certificate. If the certificate is requested in conjunction with the sale or mortgage of a unit but the closing does not occur and no later than 30 days after the closing date for which the certificate was sought the preparer receives a written request, accompanied by reasonable documentation, that the sale did not occur from a payor that is not the unit owner, the fee shall be refunded to that payor within 30 days after receipt of the request. The refund is the obligation of the unit owner, and the association may collect it from that owner in the same manner as an assessment as provided in this section. The right to reimbursement may not be waived or modified by any contract or agreement. The prevailing party in any action brought to enforce a right of reimbursement shall be awarded damages and all applicable attorney fees and costs.

(i)âThe fees specified in this subsection shall be adjusted every 5 years in an amount equal to the total of the annual increases for that 5-year period in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average, All Items. The Department of Business and Professional Regulation shall periodically calculate the fees, rounded to the nearest dollar, and publish the amounts, as adjusted, on its website.

(9)(a)âA unit owner may not be excused from payment of the unit ownerâs share of common expenses unless all other unit owners are likewise proportionately excluded from payment, except as provided in subsection (1) and in the following cases:

1.âIf authorized by the declaration, a developer who is offering units for sale may elect to be excused from payment of assessments against those unsold units for a stated period of time after the declaration is recorded. However, the developer must pay common expenses incurred during such period which exceed regular periodic assessments against other unit owners in the same condominium. The stated period must terminate no later than the first day of the fourth calendar month following the month in which the first closing occurs of a purchase contract for a unit in that condominium. If a developer-controlled association has maintained all insurance coverage required by s. [718.111](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.111)(11)(a), common expenses incurred during the stated period resulting from a natural disaster or an act of God occurring during the stated period, which are not covered by proceeds from insurance maintained by the association, may be assessed against all unit owners owning units on the date of such natural disaster or act of God, and their respective successors and assigns, including the developer with respect to units owned by the developer. In the event of such an assessment, all units shall be assessed in accordance with s. [718.115](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.115)(2).

2.âA developer who owns condominium units, and who is offering the units for sale, may be excused from payment of assessments against those unsold units for the period of time the developer has guaranteed to all purchasers or other unit owners in the same condominium that assessments will not exceed a stated dollar amount and that the developer will pay any common expenses that exceed the guaranteed amount. Such guarantee may be stated in the purchase contract, declaration, prospectus, or written agreement between the developer and a majority of the unit owners other than the developer and may provide that, after the initial guarantee period, the developer may extend the guarantee for one or more stated periods. If a developer-controlled association has maintained all insurance coverage required by s. [718.111](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.111)(11)(a), common expenses incurred during a guarantee period, as a result of a natural disaster or an act of God occurring during the same guarantee period, which are not covered by the proceeds from such insurance, may be assessed against all unit owners owning units on the date of such natural disaster or act of God, and their successors and assigns, including the developer with respect to units owned by the developer. Any such assessment shall be in accordance with s. [718.115](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.115)(2) or (4), as applicable.

(b)âIf the purchase contract, declaration, prospectus, or written agreement between the developer and a majority of unit owners other than the developer provides for the developer to be excused from payment of assessments under paragraph (a), only regular periodic assessments for common expenses as provided for in the declaration and prospectus and disclosed in the estimated operating budget shall be used for payment of common expenses during any period in which the developer is excused. Accordingly, no funds which are receivable from unit purchasers or unit owners and payable to the association, including capital contributions or startup funds collected from unit purchasers at closing, may be used for payment of such common expenses.

(c)âIf a developer of a multicondominium is excused from payment of assessments under paragraph (a), the developerâs financial obligation to the multicondominium association during any period in which the developer is excused from payment of assessments is as follows:

1.âThe developer shall pay the common expenses of a condominium affected by a guarantee, including the funding of reserves as provided in the adopted annual budget of that condominium, which exceed the regular periodic assessments at the guaranteed level against all other unit owners within that condominium.

2.âThe developer shall pay the common expenses of a multicondominium association, including the funding of reserves as provided in the adopted annual budget of the association, which are allocated to units within a condominium affected by a guarantee and which exceed the regular periodic assessments against all other unit owners within that condominium.

(10)âThe specific purpose or purposes of any special assessment, including any contingent special assessment levied in conjunction with the purchase of an insurance policy authorized by s. [718.111](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.111)(11), approved in accordance with the condominium documents shall be set forth in a written notice of such assessment sent or delivered to each unit owner. The funds collected pursuant to a special assessment shall be used only for the specific purpose or purposes set forth in such notice. However, upon completion of such specific purpose or purposes, any excess funds will be considered common surplus, and may, at the discretion of the board, either be returned to the unit owners or applied as a credit toward future assessments.

(11)(a)âIf the unit is occupied by a tenant and the unit owner is delinquent in paying any monetary obligation due to the association, the association may make a written demand that the tenant pay to the association the subsequent rental payments and continue to make such payments until all monetary obligations of the unit owner related to the unit have been paid in full to the association. The tenant must pay the monetary obligations to the association until the association releases the tenant or the tenant discontinues tenancy in the unit.

1.âThe association must provide the tenant a notice, by hand delivery or United States mail, in substantially the following form:

Pursuant to section [718.116](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.116)(11), Florida Statutes, the association demands that you pay your rent directly to the condominium association and continue doing so until the association notifies you otherwise.

Payment due the condominium association may be in the same form as you paid your landlord and must be sent by United States mail or hand delivery to Â Â (full address)Â Â , payable to Â Â (name)Â Â .

Your obligation to pay your rent to the association begins immediately, unless you have already paid rent to your landlord for the current period before receiving this notice. In that case, you must provide the association written proof of your payment within 14 days after receiving this notice and your obligation to pay rent to the association would then begin with the next rental period.

Pursuant to section [718.116](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.116)(11), Florida Statutes, your payment of rent to the association gives you complete immunity from any claim for the rent by your landlord for all amounts timely paid to the association.

2.âThe association must mail written notice to the unit owner of the associationâs demand that the tenant make payments to the association.

3.âThe association shall, upon request, provide the tenant with written receipts for payments made.

4.âA tenant is immune from any claim by the landlord or unit owner related to the rent timely paid to the association after the association has made written demand.

(b)âIf the tenant paid rent to the landlord or unit owner for a given rental period before receiving the demand from the association and provides written evidence to the association of having paid the rent within 14 days after receiving the demand, the tenant shall begin making rental payments to the association for the following rental period and shall continue making rental payments to the association to be credited against the monetary obligations of the unit owner until the association releases the tenant or the tenant discontinues tenancy in the unit.

(c)âThe liability of the tenant may not exceed the amount due from the tenant to the tenantâs landlord. The tenantâs landlord shall provide the tenant a credit against rents due to the landlord in the amount of moneys paid to the association.

(d)âThe association may issue notice under s. [83.56](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/83.56) and sue for eviction under ss. [83.59](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/83.59)-[83.625](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/83.625) as if the association were a landlord under part II of chapter 83 if the tenant fails to pay a required payment to the association after written demand has been made to the tenant. However, the association is not otherwise considered a landlord under chapter 83 and specifically has no obligations under s. [83.51](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/83.51).

(e)âThe tenant does not, by virtue of payment of monetary obligations to the association, have any of the rights of a unit owner to vote in any election or to examine the books and records of the association.

(f)âA court may supersede the effect of this subsection by appointing a receiver.

(1)âAd valorem taxes, benefit taxes, and special assessments by taxing authorities shall be assessed against the condominium parcels and not upon the condominium property as a whole. No ad valorem tax, benefit tax, or special assessment, including those made by special districts, drainage districts, or water management districts, may be separately assessed against recreational facilities or other common elements if such facilities or common elements are owned by the condominium association or are owned jointly by the owners of the condominium parcels. Each condominium parcel shall be separately assessed for ad valorem taxes and special assessments as a single parcel. The taxes and special assessments levied against each condominium parcel shall constitute a lien only upon the condominium parcel assessed and upon no other portion of the condominium property.

(2)âAll provisions of a declaration relating to a condominium parcel which has been sold for taxes or special assessments survive and are enforceable after the issuance of a tax deed or masterâs deed, upon foreclosure of an assessment, a certificate or lien, a tax deed, tax certificate, or tax lien, to the same extent that they would be enforceable against a voluntary grantee of the title immediately prior to the delivery of the tax deed, masterâs deed, or clerkâs certificate of title as provided in s. [197.573](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/197.573).

(3)âCondominium property divided into fee timeshare real property shall be assessed for purposes of ad valorem taxes and special assessments as provided in s. [192.037](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/192.037).

(1)âA lease pertaining to use by condominium unit owners of recreational or other common facilities, irrespective of the date on which such lease was entered into, is presumptively unconscionable if all of the following elements exist:

(a)âThe lease was executed by persons none of whom at the time of the execution of the lease were elected by condominium unit owners, other than the developer, to represent their interests;

(b)âThe lease requires either the condominium association or the condominium unit owners to pay real estate taxes on the subject real property;

(c)âThe lease requires either the condominium association or the condominium unit owners to insure buildings or other facilities on the subject real property against fire or any other hazard;

(d)âThe lease requires either the condominium association or the condominium unit owners to perform some or all maintenance obligations pertaining to the subject real property or facilities located upon the subject real property;

(e)âThe lease requires either the condominium association or the condominium unit owners to pay rents to the lessor for a period of 21 years or more;

(f)âThe lease provides that failure of the lessee to make payments of rents due under the lease either creates, establishes, or permits establishment of a lien upon individual condominium units of the condominium to secure claims for rent;

(g)âThe lease requires an annual rental which exceeds 25 percent of the appraised value of the leased property as improved, provided that, for purposes of this paragraph, âannual rentalâ means the amount due during the first 12 months of the lease for all units, regardless of whether such units were in fact occupied or sold during that period, and âappraised valueâ means the appraised value placed upon the leased property the first tax year after the sale of a unit in the condominium;

(h)âThe lease provides for a periodic rental increase; and

(i)âThe lease or other condominium documents require that every transferee of a condominium unit must assume obligations under the lease.

(2)âThe Legislature expressly finds that many leases involving use of recreational or other common facilities by residents of condominiums were entered into by parties wholly representative of the interests of a condominium developer at a time when the condominium unit owners not only did not control the administration of their condominium, but also had little or no voice in such administration. Such leases often contain numerous obligations on the part of either or both a condominium association and condominium unit owners with relatively few obligations on the part of the lessor. Such leases may or may not be unconscionable in any given case. Nevertheless, the Legislature finds that a combination of certain onerous obligations and circumstances warrants the establishment of a rebuttable presumption of unconscionability of certain leases, as specified in subsection (1). The presumption may be rebutted by a lessor upon the showing of additional facts and circumstances to justify and validate what otherwise appears to be an unconscionable lease under this section. Failure of a lease to contain all the enumerated elements shall neither preclude a determination of unconscionability of the lease nor raise a presumption as to its conscionability. It is the intent of the Legislature that this section is remedial and does not create any new cause of action to invalidate any condominium lease, but shall operate as a statutory prescription on procedural matters in actions brought on one or more causes of action existing at the time of the execution of such lease.

(3)âAny provision of the Florida Statutes to the contrary notwithstanding, neither the statute of limitations nor laches shall prohibit unit owners from maintaining a cause of action under the provisions of this section.

718.1224âProhibition against SLAPP suits.â

(1)âIt is the intent of the Legislature to protect the right of condominium unit owners to exercise their rights to instruct their representatives and petition for redress of grievances before the various governmental entities of this state as protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and s. 5, Art. I of the State Constitution. The Legislature recognizes that strategic lawsuits against public participation, or âSLAPP suits,â as they are typically referred to, have occurred when association members are sued by individuals, business entities, or governmental entities arising out of a condominium unit ownerâs appearance and presentation before a governmental entity on matters related to the condominium association. However, it is the public policy of this state that governmental entities, business organizations, and individuals not engage in SLAPP suits, because such actions are inconsistent with the right of condominium unit owners to participate in the stateâs institutions of government. Therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that prohibiting such lawsuits by governmental entities, business entities, and individuals against condominium unit owners who address matters concerning their condominium association will preserve this fundamental state policy, preserve the constitutional rights of condominium unit owners, and ensure the continuation of representative government in this state. It is the intent of the Legislature that such lawsuits be expeditiously disposed of by the courts. As used in this subsection, the term âgovernmental entityâ means the state, including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government; the independent establishments of the state, counties, municipalities, districts, authorities, boards, or commissions; or any agencies of these branches that are subject to chapter 286.

(2)âA governmental entity, business organization, or individual in this state may not file or cause to be filed through its employees or agents any lawsuit, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, or counterclaim against a condominium unit owner without merit and solely because such condominium unit owner has exercised the right to instruct his or her representatives or the right to petition for redress of grievances before the various governmental entities of this state, as protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and s. 5, Art. I of the State Constitution.

(3)âA condominium unit owner sued by a governmental entity, business organization, or individual in violation of this section has a right to an expeditious resolution of a claim that the suit is in violation of this section. A condominium unit owner may petition the court for an order dismissing the action or granting final judgment in favor of that condominium unit owner. The petitioner may file a motion for summary judgment, together with supplemental affidavits, seeking a determination that the governmental entityâs, business organizationâs, or individualâs lawsuit has been brought in violation of this section. The governmental entity, business organization, or individual shall thereafter file its response and any supplemental affidavits. As soon as practicable, the court shall set a hearing on the petitionerâs motion, which shall be held at the earliest possible time after the filing of the governmental entityâs, business organizationâs, or individualâs response. The court may award the condominium unit owner sued by the governmental entity, business organization, or individual actual damages arising from the governmental entityâs, individualâs, or business organizationâs violation of this section. A court may treble the damages awarded to a prevailing condominium unit owner and shall state the basis for the treble damages award in its judgment. The court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorneyâs fees and costs incurred in connection with a claim that an action was filed in violation of this section.

(4)âCondominium associations may not expend association funds in prosecuting a SLAPP suit against a condominium unit owner.

718.1255âAlternative dispute resolution; mediation; nonbinding arbitration; applicability.â

[1](#1)(1)âDEFINITIONS.âAs used in this section, the term âdisputeâ means any disagreement between two or more parties that involves:

(a)âThe authority of the board of directors, under this chapter or association document, to:

1.âRequire any owner to take any action, or not to take any action, involving that ownerâs unit or the appurtenances thereto.

2.âAlter or add to a common area or element.

(b)âThe failure of a governing body, when required by this chapter or an association document, to:

1.âProperly conduct elections.

2.âGive adequate notice of meetings or other actions.

3.âProperly conduct meetings.

4.âAllow inspection of books and records.

(c)âA plan of termination pursuant to s. [718.117](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.117).

âDisputeâ does not include any disagreement that primarily involves: title to any unit or common element; the interpretation or enforcement of any warranty; the levy of a fee or assessment, or the collection of an assessment levied against a party; the eviction or other removal of a tenant from a unit; alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by one or more directors; or claims for damages to a unit based upon the alleged failure of the association to maintain the common elements or condominium property.

(2)âMEDIATION.âMediation through Citizen Dispute Settlement Centers as provided for in s. [44.201](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/44.201) is encouraged.

(3)âLEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.â

(a)âThe Legislature finds that unit owners are frequently at a disadvantage when litigating against an association. Specifically, a condominium association, with its statutory assessment authority, is often more able to bear the costs and expenses of litigation than the unit owner who must rely on his or her own financial resources to satisfy the costs of litigation against the association.

(b)âThe Legislature finds that alternative dispute resolution has been making progress in reducing court dockets and trials and in offering a more efficient, cost-effective option to court litigation. However, the Legislature also finds that alternative dispute resolution should not be used as a mechanism to encourage the filing of frivolous or nuisance suits.

(c)âThere exists a need to develop a flexible means of alternative dispute resolution that directs disputes to the most efficient means of resolution.

(d)âThe high cost and significant delay of circuit court litigation faced by unit owners in the state can be alleviated by requiring nonbinding arbitration and mediation in appropriate cases, thereby reducing delay and attorney fees while preserving the right of either party to have its case heard by a jury, if applicable, in a court of law.

(4)âNONBINDING ARBITRATION AND MEDIATION OF DISPUTES.âThe Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation may employ full-time attorneys to act as arbitrators to conduct the arbitration hearings provided by this chapter. The division may also certify attorneys who are not employed by the division to act as arbitrators to conduct the arbitration hearings provided by this chapter. A person may not be employed by the department as a full-time arbitrator unless he or she is a member in good standing of The Florida Bar. A person may only be certified by the division to act as an arbitrator if he or she has been a member in good standing of The Florida Bar for at least 5 years and has mediated or arbitrated at least 10 disputes involving condominiums in this state during the 3 years immediately preceding the date of application, mediated or arbitrated at least 30 disputes in any subject area in this state during the 3 years immediately preceding the date of application, or attained board certification in real estate law or condominium and planned development law from The Florida Bar. Arbitrator certification is valid for 1 year. An arbitrator who does not maintain the minimum qualifications for initial certification may not have his or her certification renewed. The department may not enter into a legal services contract for an arbitration hearing under this chapter with an attorney who is not a certified arbitrator unless a certified arbitrator is not available within 50 miles of the dispute. The department shall adopt rules of procedure to govern such arbitration hearings including mediation incident thereto. The decision of an arbitrator is final; however, a decision is not deemed final agency action. Nothing in this provision shall be construed to foreclose parties from proceeding in a trial de novo unless the parties have agreed that the arbitration is binding. If judicial proceedings are initiated, the final decision of the arbitrator is admissible in evidence in the trial de novo.

(a)âBefore the institution of court litigation, a party to a dispute, other than an election or recall dispute, shall either petition the division for nonbinding arbitration or initiate presuit mediation as provided in subsection (5). Arbitration is binding on the parties if all parties in arbitration agree to be bound in a writing filed in arbitration. The petition must be accompanied by a filing fee in the amount of $50. Filing fees collected under this section must be used to defray the expenses of the alternative dispute resolution program.

(b)âThe petition must recite, and have attached thereto, supporting proof that the petitioner gave the respondents:

1.âAdvance written notice of the specific nature of the dispute;

2.âA demand for relief, and a reasonable opportunity to comply or to provide the relief; and

3.âNotice of the intention to file an arbitration petition or other legal action in the absence of a resolution of the dispute.

Failure to include the allegations or proof of compliance with these prerequisites requires dismissal of the petition without prejudice.

(c)âUpon receipt, the petition shall be promptly reviewed by the division to determine the existence of a dispute and compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b). If emergency relief is required and is not available through arbitration, a motion to stay the arbitration may be filed. The motion must be accompanied by a verified petition alleging facts that, if proven, would support entry of a temporary injunction, and if an appropriate motion and supporting papers are filed, the division may abate the arbitration pending a court hearing and disposition of a motion for temporary injunction.

(d)âUpon determination by the division that a dispute exists and that the petition substantially meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) and any other applicable rules, the division shall assign or enter into a contract with an arbitrator and serve a copy of the petition upon all respondents. The arbitrator shall conduct a hearing within 30 days after being assigned or entering into a contract unless the petition is withdrawn or a continuance is granted for good cause shown.

(e)âBefore or after the filing of the respondentsâ answer to the petition, any party may request that the arbitrator refer the case to mediation under this section and any rules adopted by the division. Upon receipt of a request for mediation, the division shall promptly contact the parties to determine if there is agreement that mediation would be appropriate. If all parties agree, the dispute must be referred to mediation. Notwithstanding a lack of an agreement by all parties, the arbitrator may refer a dispute to mediation at any time.

(f)âUpon referral of a case to mediation, the parties must select a mutually acceptable mediator. To assist in the selection, the arbitrator shall provide the parties with a list of both volunteer and paid mediators that have been certified by the division under s. [718.501](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.501). If the parties are unable to agree on a mediator within the time allowed by the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall appoint a mediator from the list of certified mediators. If a case is referred to mediation, the parties shall attend a mediation conference, as scheduled by the parties and the mediator. If any party fails to attend a duly noticed mediation conference, without the permission or approval of the arbitrator or mediator, the arbitrator must impose sanctions against the party, including the striking of any pleadings filed, the entry of an order of dismissal or default if appropriate, and the award of costs and attorney fees incurred by the other parties. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties or as provided by order of the arbitrator, a party is deemed to have appeared at a mediation conference by the physical presence of the party or its representative having full authority to settle without further consultation, provided that an association may comply by having one or more representatives present with full authority to negotiate a settlement and recommend that the board of administration ratify and approve such a settlement within 5 days from the date of the mediation conference. The parties shall share equally the expense of mediation, unless they agree otherwise.

(g)âThe purpose of mediation as provided for by this section is to present the parties with an opportunity to resolve the underlying dispute in good faith, and with a minimum expenditure of time and resources.

(h)âMediation proceedings must generally be conducted in accordance with the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, and these proceedings are privileged and confidential to the same extent as court-ordered mediation. Persons who are not parties to the dispute are not allowed to attend the mediation conference without the consent of all parties, with the exception of counsel for the parties and corporate representatives designated to appear for a party. If the mediator declares an impasse after a mediation conference has been held, the arbitration proceeding terminates, unless all parties agree in writing to continue the arbitration proceeding, in which case the arbitratorâs decision shall be binding or nonbinding, as agreed upon by the parties; in the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall not consider any evidence relating to the unsuccessful mediation except in a proceeding to impose sanctions for failure to appear at the mediation conference. If the parties do not agree to continue arbitration, the arbitrator shall enter an order of dismissal, and either party may institute a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction. The parties may seek to recover any costs and attorney fees incurred in connection with arbitration and mediation proceedings under this section as part of the costs and fees that may be recovered by the prevailing party in any subsequent litigation.

(i)âArbitration shall be conducted according to rules adopted by the division. The filing of a petition for arbitration shall toll the applicable statute of limitations.

(j)âAt the request of any party to the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, records, documents, and other evidence and any party on whose behalf a subpoena is issued may apply to the court for orders compelling such attendance and production. Subpoenas shall be served and shall be enforceable in the manner provided by the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. Discovery may, in the discretion of the arbitrator, be permitted in the manner provided by the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. Rules adopted by the division may authorize any reasonable sanctions except contempt for a violation of the arbitration procedural rules of the division or for the failure of a party to comply with a reasonable nonfinal order issued by an arbitrator which is not under judicial review.

(k)âThe arbitration decision shall be rendered within 30 days after the hearing and presented to the parties in writing. An arbitration decision is final in those disputes in which the parties have agreed to be bound. An arbitration decision is also final if a complaint for a trial de novo is not filed in a court of competent jurisdiction in which the condominium is located within 30 days. The right to file for a trial de novo entitles the parties to file a complaint in the appropriate trial court for a judicial resolution of the dispute. The prevailing party in an arbitration proceeding shall be awarded the costs of the arbitration and reasonable attorney fees in an amount determined by the arbitrator. Such an award shall include the costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in the arbitration proceeding as well as the costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in preparing for and attending any scheduled mediation. An arbitratorâs failure to render a written decision within 30 days after the hearing may result in the cancellation of his or her arbitration certification.

(l)âThe party who files a complaint for a trial de novo shall be assessed the other partyâs arbitration costs, court costs, and other reasonable costs, including attorney fees, investigation expenses, and expenses for expert or other testimony or evidence incurred after the arbitration hearing if the judgment upon the trial de novo is not more favorable than the arbitration decision. If the judgment is more favorable, the party who filed a complaint for trial de novo shall be awarded reasonable court costs and attorney fees.

(m)âAny party to an arbitration proceeding may enforce an arbitration award by filing a petition in a court of competent jurisdiction in which the condominium is located. A petition may not be granted unless the time for appeal by the filing of a complaint for trial de novo has expired. If a complaint for a trial de novo has been filed, a petition may not be granted with respect to an arbitration award that has been stayed. If the petition for enforcement is granted, the petitioner shall recover reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in enforcing the arbitration award. A mediation settlement may also be enforced through the county or circuit court, as applicable, and any costs and fees incurred in the enforcement of a settlement agreement reached at mediation must be awarded to the prevailing party in any enforcement action.

[1](#1)(5)âPRESUIT MEDIATION.âIn lieu of the initiation of nonbinding arbitration as provided in subsections (1)-(4), a party may submit a dispute to presuit mediation in accordance with s. [720.311](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.311); however, election and recall disputes are not eligible for mediation and such disputes must be arbitrated by the division or filed in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(6)âDISPUTES INVOLVING ELECTION IRREGULARITIES.âEvery arbitration petition received by the division and required to be filed under this section challenging the legality of the election of any director of the board of administration must be handled on an expedited basis in the manner provided by the divisionâs rules for recall arbitration disputes.

(7)âAPPLICABILITY.âThis section does not apply to a nonresidential condominium unless otherwise specifically provided for in the declaration of the nonresidential condominium.

(5)âPRESUIT MEDIATION.âIn lieu of the initiation of nonbinding arbitration as provided in subsections (1)-(4), a party may submit a dispute to presuit mediation in accordance with s. 720.311; however, election and recall disputes are not eligible for mediation and such disputes must be arbitrated by the division or filed in a court of competent jurisdiction. Disputes identified in paragraph (1)(d) are not subject to nonbinding arbitration under subsection (4) and must be submitted to presuit mediation in accordance with s. 720.311.

718.301âTransfer of association control; claims of defect by association.â

(1)âIf unit owners other than the developer own 15 percent or more of the units in a condominium that will be operated ultimately by an association, the unit owners other than the developer are entitled to elect at least one-third of the members of the board of administration of the association. Unit owners other than the developer are entitled to elect at least a majority of the members of the board of administration of an association, upon the first to occur of any of the following events:

(a)âThree years after 50 percent of the units that will be operated ultimately by the association have been conveyed to purchasers;

(b)âThree months after 90 percent of the units that will be operated ultimately by the association have been conveyed to purchasers;

(c)âWhen all the units that will be operated ultimately by the association have been completed, some of them have been conveyed to purchasers, and none of the others are being offered for sale by the developer in the ordinary course of business;

(d)âWhen some of the units have been conveyed to purchasers and none of the others are being constructed or offered for sale by the developer in the ordinary course of business;

(e)âWhen the developer files a petition seeking protection in bankruptcy;

(f)âWhen a receiver for the developer is appointed by a circuit court and is not discharged within 30 days after such appointment, unless the court determines within 30 days after appointment of the receiver that transfer of control would be detrimental to the association or its members; or

(g)âSeven years after the date of the recording of the certificate of a surveyor and mapper pursuant to s. [718.104](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.104)(4)(e) or the recording of an instrument that transfers title to a unit in the condominium which is not accompanied by a recorded assignment of developer rights in favor of the grantee of such unit, whichever occurs first; or, in the case of an association that may ultimately operate more than one condominium, 7 years after the date of the recording of the certificate of a surveyor and mapper pursuant to s. [718.104](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.104)(4)(e) or the recording of an instrument that transfers title to a unit which is not accompanied by a recorded assignment of developer rights in favor of the grantee of such unit, whichever occurs first, for the first condominium it operates; or, in the case of an association operating a phase condominium created pursuant to s. [718.403](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.403), 7 years after the date of the recording of the certificate of a surveyor and mapper pursuant to s. [718.104](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.104)(4)(e) or the recording of an instrument that transfers title to a unit which is not accompanied by a recorded assignment of developer rights in favor of the grantee of such unit, whichever occurs first.

The developer is entitled to elect at least one member of the board of administration of an association as long as the developer holds for sale in the ordinary course of business at least 5 percent, in condominiums with fewer than 500 units, and 2 percent, in condominiums with more than 500 units, of the units in a condominium operated by the association. After the developer relinquishes control of the association, the developer may exercise the right to vote any developer-owned units in the same manner as any other unit owner except for purposes of reacquiring control of the association or selecting the majority members of the board of administration.

(2)âWithin 75 days after the unit owners other than the developer are entitled to elect a member or members of the board of administration of an association, the association shall call, and give not less than 60 daysâ notice of an election for the members of the board of administration. The election shall proceed as provided in s. [718.112](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.112)(2)(d). The notice may be given by any unit owner if the association fails to do so. Upon election of the first unit owner other than the developer to the board of administration, the developer shall forward to the division the name and mailing address of the unit owner board member.

(3)âIf a developer holds units for sale in the ordinary course of business, none of the following actions may be taken without approval in writing by the developer:

(a)âAssessment of the developer as a unit owner for capital improvements.

(b)âAny action by the association that would be detrimental to the sales of units by the developer. However, an increase in assessments for common expenses without discrimination against the developer shall not be deemed to be detrimental to the sales of units.

(4)âAt the time that unit owners other than the developer elect a majority of the members of the board of administration of an association, the developer shall relinquish control of the association, and the unit owners shall accept control. Simultaneously, or for the purposes of paragraph (c) not more than 90 days thereafter, the developer shall deliver to the association, at the developerâs expense, all property of the unit owners and of the association which is held or controlled by the developer, including, but not limited to, the following items, if applicable, as to each condominium operated by the association:

(a)1.âThe original or a photocopy of the recorded declaration of condominium and all amendments thereto. If a photocopy is provided, it must be certified by affidavit of the developer or an officer or agent of the developer as being a complete copy of the actual recorded declaration.

2.âA certified copy of the articles of incorporation of the association or, if the association was created prior to the effective date of this act and it is not incorporated, copies of the documents creating the association.

718.302âAgreements entered into by the association.â

(1)âAny grant or reservation made by a declaration, lease, or other document, and any contract made by an association prior to assumption of control of the association by unit owners other than the developer, that provides for operation, maintenance, or management of a condominium association or property serving the unit owners of a condominium shall be fair and reasonable, and such grant, reservation, or contract may be canceled by unit owners other than the developer:

(a)âIf the association operates only one condominium and the unit owners other than the developer have assumed control of the association, or if unit owners other than the developer own not less than 75 percent of the voting interests in the condominium, the cancellation shall be by concurrence of the owners of not less than 75 percent of the voting interests other than the voting interests owned by the developer. If a grant, reservation, or contract is so canceled and the unit owners other than the developer have not assumed control of the association, the association shall make a new contract or otherwise provide for maintenance, management, or operation in lieu of the canceled obligation, at the direction of the owners of not less than a majority of the voting interests in the condominium other than the voting interests owned by the developer.

(b)âIf the association operates more than one condominium and the unit owners other than the developer have not assumed control of the association, and if unit owners other than the developer own at least 75 percent of the voting interests in a condominium operated by the association, any grant, reservation, or contract for maintenance, management, or operation of buildings containing the units in that condominium or of improvements used only by unit owners of that condominium may be canceled by concurrence of the owners of at least 75 percent of the voting interests in the condominium other than the voting interests owned by the developer. No grant, reservation, or contract for maintenance, management, or operation of recreational areas or any other property serving more than one condominium, and operated by more than one association, may be canceled except pursuant to paragraph (d).

(c)âIf the association operates more than one condominium and the unit owners other than the developer have assumed control of the association, the cancellation shall be by concurrence of the owners of not less than 75 percent of the total number of voting interests in all condominiums operated by the association other than the voting interests owned by the developer.

(d)âIf the owners of units in a condominium have the right to use property in common with owners of units in other condominiums and those condominiums are operated by more than one association, no grant, reservation, or contract for maintenance, management, or operation of the property serving more than one condominium may be canceled until unit owners other than the developer have assumed control of all of the associations operating the condominiums that are to be served by the recreational area or other property, after which cancellation may be effected by concurrence of the owners of not less than 75 percent of the total number of voting interests in those condominiums other than voting interests owned by the developer.

(2)âAny grant or reservation made by a declaration, lease, or other document, or any contract made by the developer or association prior to the time when unit owners other than the developer elect a majority of the board of administration, which grant, reservation, or contract requires the association to purchase condominium property or to lease condominium property to another party, shall be deemed ratified unless rejected by a majority of the voting interests of unit owners other than the developer within 18 months after unit owners other than the developer elect a majority of the board of administration. This subsection does not apply to any grant or reservation made by a declaration whereby persons other than the developer or the developerâs heirs, assigns, affiliates, directors, officers, or employees are granted the right to use the condominium property, so long as such persons are obligated to pay, at a minimum, a proportionate share of the cost associated with such property.

(3)âAny grant or reservation made by a declaration, lease, or other document, and any contract made by an association, whether before or after assumption of control of the association by unit owners other than the developer, that provides for operation, maintenance, or management of a condominium association or property serving the unit owners of a condominium shall not be in conflict with the powers and duties of the association or the rights of the unit owners as provided in this chapter. This subsection is intended only as a clarification of existing law.

(4)âAny grant or reservation made by a declaration, lease, or other document, and any contract made by an association prior to assumption of control of the association by unit owners other than the developer, shall be fair and reasonable.

(5)âIt is declared that the public policy of this state prohibits the inclusion or enforcement of escalation clauses in management contracts for condominiums, and such clauses are hereby declared void for public policy. For the purposes of this section, an escalation clause is any clause in a condominium management contract which provides that the fee under the contract shall increase at the same percentage rate as any nationally recognized and conveniently available commodity or consumer price index.

(6)âAny action to compel compliance with the provisions of this section or of s. [718.301](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.301) may be brought pursuant to the summary procedure provided for in s. [51.011](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/51.011).

(3)âAny services or obligations not stated on the face of the contract shall be unenforceable.

(4)âNotwithstanding the fact that certain vendors contract with associations to maintain equipment or property which is made available to serve unit owners, it is the intent of the Legislature that this section applies to contracts for maintenance or management services for which the association pays compensation. This section does not apply to contracts for services or property made available for the convenience of unit owners by lessees or licensees of the association, such as coin-operated laundry, food, soft drink, or telephone vendors; cable television operators; retail store operators; businesses; restaurants; or similar vendors.

[718.301](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.301), which is not a timeshare condominium association, or by an officer or board member of such party, the contract with the party providing maintenance or management services may be canceled by a majority vote of the unit owners other than the contracting party or an officer or board member of such party.

718.3027âConflicts of interest.â

(1)âDirectors and officers of a board of an association that is not a timeshare condominium association, and the relatives of such directors and officers, must disclose to the board any activity that may reasonably be construed to be a conflict of interest. A rebuttable presumption of a conflict of interest exists if any of the following occurs without prior notice, as required in subsection (5):

(a)âA director or an officer, or a relative of a director or an officer, enters into a contract for goods or services with the association.

(b)âA director or an officer, or a relative of a director or an officer, holds an interest in a corporation, limited liability corporation, partnership, limited liability partnership, or other business entity that conducts business with the association or proposes to enter into a contract or other transaction with the association.

The association shall comply with the requirements of s. [617.0832](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/617.0832), and the disclosures required by s. [617.0832](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/617.0832) shall be entered into the written minutes of the meeting. Approval of the contract or other transaction requires an affirmative vote of two-thirds of all other directors present. At the next regular or special meeting of the members, the existence of the contract or other transaction shall be disclosed to the members. Upon motion of any member, the contract or transaction shall be brought up for a vote and may be canceled by a majority vote of the members present. If the contract is canceled, the association is only liable for the reasonable value of the goods and services provided up to the time of cancellation and is not liable for any termination fee, liquidated damages, or other form of penalty for such cancellation.

(3)âIf the board votes against the proposed activity, the director or officer, or the relative of the director or officer, must notify the board in writing of his or her intention not to pursue the proposed activity or to withdraw from office. If the board finds that an officer or a director has violated this subsection, the officer or director shall be deemed removed from office. The vacancy shall be filled according to general law.

(4)âA director or an officer, or a relative of a director or an officer, who is a party to, or has an interest in, an activity that is a possible conflict of interest, as described in subsection (1), may attend the meeting at which the activity is considered by the board and is authorized to make a presentation to the board regarding the activity. After the presentation, the director or officer, or the relative of the director or officer, must leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the activity. A director or an officer who is a party to, or has an interest in, the activity must recuse himself or herself from the vote.

(5)âA contract entered into between a director or an officer, or a relative of a director or an officer, and the association, which is not a timeshare condominium association, that has not been properly disclosed as a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest as required by s. [718.111](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.111)(12)(g) is voidable and terminates upon the filing of a written notice terminating the contract with the board of directors which contains the consent of at least 20 percent of the voting interests of the association.

(6)âAs used in this section, the term ârelativeâ means a relative within the third degree of consanguinity by blood or marriage.

Source: [https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0718.303](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0718.303)

718.303âObligations of owners and occupants; remedies.â

(1)âEach unit owner, tenant and other invitee, and association is governed by, and must comply with the provisions of, this chapter, the declaration, the documents creating the association, and the association bylaws which are expressly incorporated into any lease of a unit. Actions at law or in equity, or both, for failure to comply with these provisions may be brought by the association or by a unit owner against:

(a)âThe association.

(b)âA unit owner.

(c)âDirectors designated by the developer, for actions taken by them before control of the association is assumed by unit owners other than the developer.

(d)âAny director who willfully and knowingly fails to comply with these provisions.

(e)âAny tenant leasing a unit, and any other invitee occupying a unit.

The prevailing party in any such action or in any action in which the purchaser claims a right of voidability based upon contractual provisions as required in s. [718.503](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.503)(1)(a) is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees. A unit owner prevailing in an action between the association and the unit owner under this subsection, in addition to recovering his or her reasonable attorney fees, may recover additional amounts as determined by the court to be necessary to reimburse the unit owner for his or her share of assessments levied by the association to fund its expenses of the litigation. This relief does not exclude other remedies provided by law. Actions arising under this subsection are not considered actions for specific performance.

(2)âA provision of this chapter may not be waived if the waiver would adversely affect the rights of a unit owner or the purpose of the provision, except that unit owners or members of a board of administration may waive notice of specific meetings in writing if provided by the bylaws. Any instruction given in writing by a unit owner or purchaser to an escrow agent may be relied upon by an escrow agent, whether or not such instruction and the payment of funds thereunder might constitute a waiver of any provision of this chapter.

(3)âThe association may levy reasonable fines for the failure of the owner of the unit or its occupant, licensee, or invitee to comply with any provision of the declaration, the association bylaws, or reasonable rules of the association. A fine may not become a lien against a unit. A fine may be levied by the board on the basis of each day of a continuing violation, with a single notice and opportunity for hearing before a committee as provided in paragraph (b). However, the fine may not exceed $100 per violation, or $1,000 in the aggregate.

(a)âAn association may suspend, for a reasonable period of time, the right of a unit owner, or a unit ownerâs tenant, guest, or invitee, to use the common elements, common facilities, or any other association property for failure to comply with any provision of the declaration, the association bylaws, or reasonable rules of the association. This paragraph does not apply to limited common elements intended to be used only by that unit, common elements needed to access the unit, utility services provided to the unit, parking spaces, or elevators.

(b)âA fine or suspension levied by the board of administration may not be imposed unless the board first provides at least 14 daysâ written notice to the unit owner and, if applicable, any tenant, licensee, or invitee of the unit owner sought to be fined or suspended, and an opportunity for a hearing before a committee of at least three members appointed by the board who are not officers, directors, or employees of the association, or the spouse, parent, child, brother, or sister of an officer, director, or employee. The role of the committee is limited to determining whether to confirm or reject the fine or suspension levied by the board. If the committee does not approve the proposed fine or suspension by majority vote, the fine or suspension may not be imposed. If the proposed fine or suspension is approved by the committee, the fine payment is due 5 days after notice of the approved fine is provided to the unit owner and, if applicable, to any tenant, licensee, or invitee of the unit owner. The association must provide written notice of such fine or suspension by mail or hand delivery to the unit owner and, if applicable, to any tenant, licensee, or invitee of the unit owner.

(4)âIf a unit owner is more than 90 days delinquent in paying a fee, fine, or other monetary obligation due to the association, the association may suspend the right of the unit owner or the unitâs occupant, licensee, or invitee to use common elements, common facilities, or any other association property until the fee, fine, or other monetary obligation is paid in full. This subsection does not apply to limited common elements intended to be used only by that unit, common elements needed to access the unit, utility services provided to the unit, parking spaces, or elevators. The notice and hearing requirements under subsection (3) do not apply to suspensions imposed under this subsection.

(5)âAn association may suspend the voting rights of a unit owner or member due to nonpayment of any fee, fine, or other monetary obligation due to the association which is more than $1,000 and more than 90 days delinquent. Proof of such obligation must be provided to the unit owner or member 30 days before such suspension takes effect. A voting interest or consent right allocated to a unit owner or member which has been suspended by the association shall be subtracted from the total number of voting interests in the association, which shall be reduced by the number of suspended voting interests when calculating the total percentage or number of all voting interests available to take or approve any action, and the suspended voting interests shall not be considered for any purpose, including, but not limited to, the percentage or number of voting interests necessary to constitute a quorum, the percentage or number of voting interests required to conduct an election, or the percentage or number of voting interests required to approve an action under this chapter or pursuant to the declaration, articles of incorporation, or bylaws. The suspension ends upon full payment of all obligations currently due or overdue the association. The notice and hearing requirements under subsection (3) do not apply to a suspension imposed under this subsection.

(6)âAll suspensions imposed pursuant to subsection (4) or subsection (5) must be approved at a properly noticed board meeting. Upon approval, the association must notify the unit owner and, if applicable, the unitâs occupant, licensee, or invitee by mail or hand delivery.

(7)âThe suspensions permitted by paragraph (3)(a) and subsections (4) and (5) apply to a member and, when appropriate, the memberâs tenants, guests, or invitees, even if the delinquency or failure that resulted in the suspension arose from less than all of the multiple units owned by a member.

(8)âA receiver may not exercise voting rights of any unit owner whose unit is placed in receivership for the benefit of the association pursuant to this chapter.

(1)âIt is declared that the public policy of this state prohibits the inclusion or enforcement of escalation clauses in land leases or other leases or agreements for recreational facilities, land, or other commonly used facilities serving residential cooperatives, and such clauses are hereby declared void for public policy. For the purposes of this section, an escalation clause is any clause in a cooperative lease or agreement which provides that the rental under the lease or agreement shall increase at the same percentage rate as any nationally recognized and conveniently available commodity or consumer price index.

(2)âThis public policy prohibits the inclusion or enforcement of such escalation clauses in leases related to cooperatives for which the cooperative documents were recorded on or after June 4, 1975; it prohibits the enforcement of escalation clauses in leases related to cooperatives for which the cooperative documents were recorded prior to June 4, 1975, but which have been refused enforcement on the grounds that the parties agreed to be bound by subsequent amendments to the Florida Statutes or which have been found to be void because of a finding that such lease is unconscionable or which have been refused enforcement on the basis of the application of former s. [719.401](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.401)(8); and it prohibits any further escalation of rental fees after October 1, 1988, pursuant to escalation clauses in leases related to cooperatives for which the cooperative documents were recorded prior to June 4, 1975.

(3)âThe provisions of this section do not apply if the lessor is the Government of the United States or the State of Florida or any political subdivision thereof or any agency of any political subdivision thereof.

719.501âPowers and duties of Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes.â

(1)âThe Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation, referred to as the âdivisionâ in this part, in addition to other powers and duties prescribed by chapter 718, has the power to enforce and ensure compliance with this chapter and adopted rules relating to the development, construction, sale, lease, ownership, operation, and management of residential cooperative units; complaints related to the procedural completion of the structural integrity reserve studies under s. [719.106](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.106)(1)(k); and complaints related to the procedural completion of milestone inspections under s. [553.899](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/553.899). In performing its duties, the division shall have the following powers and duties:

(a)âThe division may make necessary public or private investigations within or outside this state to determine whether any person has violated this chapter or any rule or order hereunder, to aid in the enforcement of this chapter, or to aid in the adoption of rules or forms hereunder.

(b)âThe division may require or permit any person to file a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise, as the division determines, as to the facts and circumstances concerning a matter to be investigated.

(c)âFor the purpose of any investigation under this chapter, the division director or any officer or employee designated by the division director may administer oaths or affirmations, subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any matter which is relevant to the investigation, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of relevant facts or any other matter reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of material evidence. Upon failure by a person to obey a subpoena or to answer questions propounded by the investigating officer and upon reasonable notice to all persons affected thereby, the division may apply to the circuit court for an order compelling compliance.

(d)âNotwithstanding any remedies available to unit owners and associations, if the division has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of any provision of this chapter or related rule has occurred, the division may institute enforcement proceedings in its own name against a developer, association, officer, or member of the board, or its assignees or agents, as follows:

1.âThe division may permit a person whose conduct or actions may be under investigation to waive formal proceedings and enter into a consent proceeding whereby orders, rules, or letters of censure or warning, whether formal or informal, may be entered against the person.

2.âThe division may issue an order requiring the developer, association, officer, or member of the board, or its assignees or agents, to cease and desist from the unlawful practice and take such affirmative action as in the judgment of the division will carry out the purposes of this chapter. Such affirmative action may include, but is not limited to, an order requiring a developer to pay moneys determined to be owed to a condominium association.

3.âThe division may bring an action in circuit court on behalf of a class of unit owners, lessees, or purchasers for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, or restitution.

4.âThe division may impose a civil penalty against a developer or association, or its assignees or agents, for any violation of this chapter or related rule. The division may impose a civil penalty individually against any officer or board member who willfully and knowingly violates a provision of this chapter, a rule adopted pursuant to this chapter, or a final order of the division. The term âwillfully and knowinglyâ means that the division informed the officer or board member that his or her action or intended action violates this chapter, a rule adopted under this chapter, or a final order of the division, and that the officer or board member refused to comply with the requirements of this chapter, a rule adopted under this chapter, or a final order of the division. The division, prior to initiating formal agency action under chapter 120, shall afford the officer or board member an opportunity to voluntarily comply with this chapter, a rule adopted under this chapter, or a final order of the division. An officer or board member who complies within 10 days is not subject to a civil penalty. A penalty may be imposed on the basis of each day of continuing violation, but in no event shall the penalty for any offense exceed $5,000. The division shall adopt, by rule, penalty guidelines applicable to possible violations or to categories of violations of this chapter or rules adopted by the division. The guidelines must specify a meaningful range of civil penalties for each such violation of the statute and rules and must be based upon the harm caused by the violation, upon the repetition of the violation, and upon such other factors deemed relevant by the division. For example, the division may consider whether the violations were committed by a developer or owner-controlled association, the size of the association, and other factors. The guidelines must designate the possible mitigating or aggravating circumstances that justify a departure from the range of penalties provided by the rules. It is the legislative intent that minor violations be distinguished from those which endanger the health, safety, or welfare of the cooperative residents or other persons and that such guidelines provide reasonable and meaningful notice to the public of likely penalties that may be imposed for proscribed conduct. This subsection does not limit the ability of the division to informally dispose of administrative actions or complaints by stipulation, agreed settlement, or consent order. All amounts collected shall be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer to the credit of the Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes Trust Fund. If a developer fails to pay the civil penalty, the division shall thereupon issue an order directing that such developer cease and desist from further operation until such time as the civil penalty is paid or may pursue enforcement of the penalty in a court of competent jurisdiction. If an association fails to pay the civil penalty, the division shall thereupon pursue enforcement in a court of competent jurisdiction, and the order imposing the civil penalty or the cease and desist order shall not become effective until 20 days after the date of such order. Any action commenced by the division shall be brought in the county in which the division has its executive offices or in the county where the violation occurred.

(e)âThe division may prepare and disseminate a prospectus and other information to assist prospective owners, purchasers, lessees, and developers of residential cooperatives in assessing the rights, privileges, and duties pertaining thereto.

(f)âThe division has authority to adopt rules pursuant to ss. [120.536](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/120.536)(1) and [120.54](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/120.54) to implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter.

(g)âThe division shall establish procedures for providing notice to an association when the division is considering the issuance of a declaratory statement with respect to the cooperative documents governing such cooperative community.

(h)âThe division shall furnish each association which pays the fees required by paragraph (2)(a) a copy of this act, subsequent changes to this act on an annual basis, an amended version of this act as it becomes available from the Secretary of Stateâs office on a biennial basis, and the rules adopted thereto on an annual basis.

(i)âThe division shall annually provide each association with a summary of declaratory statements and formal legal opinions relating to the operations of cooperatives which were rendered by the division during the previous year.

(j)âThe division shall adopt uniform accounting principles, policies, and standards to be used by all associations in the preparation and presentation of all financial statements required by this chapter. The principles, policies, and standards shall take into consideration the size of the association and the total revenue collected by the association.

(k)âThe division shall provide training and educational programs for cooperative association board members and unit owners. The training may, in the divisionâs discretion, include web-based electronic media and live training and seminars in various locations throughout the state. The division may review and approve education and training programs for board members and unit owners offered by providers and shall maintain a current list of approved programs and providers and make such list available to board members and unit owners in a reasonable and cost-effective manner.

(l)âThe division shall maintain a toll-free telephone number accessible to cooperative unit owners.

(m)âWhen a complaint is made to the division, the division shall conduct its inquiry with reasonable dispatch and with due regard to the interests of the affected parties. Within 30 days after receipt of a complaint, the division shall acknowledge the complaint in writing and notify the complainant whether the complaint is within the jurisdiction of the division and whether additional information is needed by the division from the complainant. The division shall conduct its investigation and shall, within 90 days after receipt of the original complaint or timely requested additional information, take action upon the complaint. However, the failure to complete the investigation within 90 days does not prevent the division from continuing the investigation, accepting or considering evidence obtained or received after 90 days, or taking administrative action if reasonable cause exists to believe that a violation of this chapter or a rule of the division has occurred. If an investigation is not completed within the time limits established in this paragraph, the division shall, on a monthly basis, notify the complainant in writing of the status of the investigation. When reporting its action to the complainant, the division shall inform the complainant of any right to a hearing pursuant to ss. [120.569](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/120.569) and [120.57](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/120.57).

(n)âThe division shall develop a program to certify both volunteer and paid mediators to provide mediation of cooperative disputes. The division shall provide, upon request, a list of such mediators to any association, unit owner, or other participant in arbitration proceedings under s. [718.1255](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.1255) requesting a copy of the list. The division shall include on the list of voluntary mediators only persons who have received at least 20 hours of training in mediation techniques or have mediated at least 20 disputes. In order to become initially certified by the division, paid mediators must be certified by the Supreme Court to mediate court cases in county or circuit courts. However, the division may adopt, by rule, additional factors for the certification of paid mediators, which factors must be related to experience, education, or background. Any person initially certified as a paid mediator by the division must, in order to continue to be certified, comply with the factors or requirements imposed by rules adopted by the division.

(2)(a)âEach cooperative association shall pay to the division, on or before January 1 of each year, an annual fee in the amount of $4 for each residential unit in cooperatives operated by the association. If the fee is not paid by March 1, then the association shall be assessed a penalty of 10 percent of the amount due, and the association shall not have the standing to maintain or defend any action in the courts of this state until the amount due is paid.

(b)âAll fees shall be deposited in the Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes Trust Fund as provided by law.

(3)(a)âOn or before January 1, 2023, cooperative associations existing on or before July 1, 2022, must provide the following information to the division in writing, by e-mail, United States Postal Service, commercial delivery service, or hand delivery, at a physical address or e-mail address provided by the division and on a form posted on the divisionâs website:

1.âThe number of buildings on the cooperative property that are three stories or higher in height.

2.âThe total number of units in all such buildings.

3.âThe addresses of all such buildings.

4.âThe counties in which all such buildings are located.

(b)âThe division must compile a list of the number of buildings on cooperative property that are three stories or higher in height, which is searchable by county, and must post the list on the divisionâs website. This list must include all of the following information:

1.âThe name of each association with buildings on the cooperative property that are three stories or higher in height.

2.âThe number of such buildings on each associationâs property.

A developer shall not close on any contract for sale or contract for a lease period of more than 5 years until the developer prepares and files with the division documents complying with the requirements of this chapter and the rules promulgated by the division and until the division notifies the developer that the filing is proper. A developer shall not close on any contract for sale or contract for a lease period of more than 5 years, as further provided in s.

(3)âUpon filing as required by subsection (1), the developer shall pay to the division a filing fee of $20 for each residential unit to be sold by the developer which is described in the documents filed. If the cooperative is to be built or sold in phases, the fee shall be paid prior to offering for sale units in any subsequent phase. Every developer who holds a unit or units for sale in a cooperative shall submit to the division any amendments to documents or items on file with the division and deliver to purchasers all amendments prior to closing, but in no event later than 10 days after the amendment. Upon filing of amendments to documents currently on file with the division, the developer shall pay to the division a filing fee of up to $100 per filing, with the exact fee to be set by the division rule.

When existing improvements are converted to ownership as a residential cooperative:

(1)(a)âEach residential tenant who has resided in the existing improvements for at least the 180 days preceding the date of the written notice of intended conversion shall have the right to extend an expiring rental agreement upon the same terms for a period that will expire no later than 270 days after the date of the notice. If the rental agreement expires more than 270 days after the date of the notice, the tenant may not unilaterally extend the rental agreement.

(b)âEach other residential tenant shall have the right to extend an expiring rental agreement upon the same terms for a period that will expire no later than 180 days after the date of the written notice of intended conversion. If the rental agreement expires more than 180 days after the date of the notice, the tenant may not unilaterally extend the rental agreement.

(2)(a)âIn order to extend the rental agreement as provided in subsection (1), a tenant shall, within 45 days after the date of the written notice of intended conversion, give written notice to the developer of the intention to extend the rental agreement.

(b)âIf the rental agreement will expire within 45 days following the date of the notice, the tenant may remain in occupancy for the 45-day decision period upon the same terms by giving the developer written notice and paying rent on a pro rata basis from the expiration date of the rental agreement to the end of the 45-day period.

(c)âThe tenant may extend the rental agreement for the full extension period or a part of the period.

(3)âAfter the date of a notice of intended conversion, a tenant may terminate any rental agreement, or any extension period having an unexpired term of 180 days or less, upon 30 daysâ written notice to the developer. However, unless the rental agreement was entered into, extended, or renewed after the effective date of this part, the tenant may not unilaterally terminate the rental agreement but may unilaterally terminate any extension period having an unexpired term of 180 days or less upon 30 daysâ written notice.

(4)âA developer may elect to provide tenants who have been continuous residents of the existing improvements for at least 180 days preceding the date of the written notice of intended conversion and whose rental agreements expire within 180 days of the date of the written notice of intended conversion, the option of receiving in cash a tenant relocation payment at least equal to 1 monthâs rent in consideration for extending the rental agreement for not more than 180 days, rather than extending the rental agreement for up to 270 days.

(5)âA rental agreement may provide for termination by the developer upon 60 daysâ written notice if the rental agreement is entered into subsequent to the delivery of the written notice of intended conversion to all tenants and conspicuously states that the existing improvements are to be converted. No other provision in a rental agreement shall be enforceable to the extent that it purports to reduce the extension period provided by this section or otherwise would permit a developer to terminate a rental agreement in the event of a conversion. This subsection applies to rental agreements entered into, extended, or renewed after the effective date of this part; the termination provisions of all other rental agreements are governed by the provisions of s. [719.402](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.402)(3), Florida Statutes 1979.

(6)âAny provision of this section or of the rental agreement or other contract or agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, whenever a county, including a charter county, determines that there exists within the county a vacancy rate in rental housing of 3 percent or less, the county may adopt an ordinance or other measure extending the 270-day extension period described in paragraph (1)(a) and the 180-day extension described in paragraph (1)(b) for an additional 90 days, if:

(a)âSuch measure was duly adopted, after notice and public hearing, in accordance with all applicable provisions of the charter governing the county and any other applicable laws; and

(b)âThe governing body has made and recited in such measure its findings establishing the existence in fact of a housing emergency so grave as to constitute a serious menace to the general public and that such controls are necessary and proper to eliminate such grave housing emergency.

A county ordinance or other measure adopting an additional 90-day extension under the provisions of this section is controlling throughout the entire county, including a charter county, where adopted, including all municipalities, unless a municipality votes not to have it apply within its boundaries.

To do so, you must notify the developer in writing. You will then have the full 45 days to decide whether to extend your rental agreement as explained above.

3.âDuring the extension of your rental agreement you will be charged the same rent that you are now paying.

4.âYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR RENTAL AGREEMENT AND ANY EXTENSION OF THE RENTAL AGREEMENT AS FOLLOWS:

a.âIf your rental agreement began or was extended or renewed after May 1, 1980, and your rental agreement, including extensions and renewals, has an unexpired term of 180 days or less, you may cancel your rental agreement upon 30 daysâ written notice and move. Also, upon 30 daysâ written notice, you may cancel any extension of the rental agreement.

b.âWithin 90 days you will be provided purchase information relating to your apartment, including the price of your unit and the condition of the building. If you do not receive this information within 90 days, your rental agreement and any extension will be extended 1 day for each day over 90 days until you are given the purchase information. If you do not want this rental agreement extension, you must notify the developer in writing.

7.âIf you have any questions regarding this conversion or the Cooperative Act, you may contact the developer or the state agency which regulates cooperatives: The Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes, Â Â (Tallahassee address and telephone number of division)Â Â .

(b)âWhen a developer offers tenants an optional tenant relocation payment pursuant to s. [719.606](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.606)(4), the notice of intended conversion shall contain a statement substantially as follows:

You must make your decision and inform the developer in writing within 45 days after the date of this notice.

(1)âWhen existing improvements are converted to ownership as a residential cooperative, the developer shall establish reserve accounts for capital expenditures and deferred maintenance, or give warranties as provided by subsection (6), or post a surety bond as provided by subsection (7). The developer shall fund the reserve accounts in amounts calculated as follows:

(a)1.âWhen the existing improvements include an air-conditioning system serving more than one unit or property which the association is responsible to repair, maintain, or replace, the developer shall fund an air-conditioning reserve account. The amount of the reserve account shall be the product of the estimated current replacement cost of the system, as disclosed and substantiated pursuant to s. [719.616](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.616)(3)(b), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the lesser of the age of the system in years or 9, and the denominator of which shall be 10. When such air-conditioning system is within 1,000 yards of the seacoast, the numerator shall be the lesser of the age of the system in years or 3, and the denominator shall be 4.

2.âThe developer shall fund a plumbing reserve account. The amount of the funding shall be the product of the estimated current replacement cost of the plumbing component, as disclosed and substantiated pursuant to s. [719.616](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.616)(3)(b), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the lesser of the age of the plumbing in years or 36, and the denominator of which shall be 40.

3.âThe developer shall fund a roof reserve account. The amount of the funding shall be the product of the estimated current replacement cost of the roofing component, as disclosed and substantiated pursuant to s. [719.616](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.616)(3)(b), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the lesser of the age of the roof in years or the numerator listed in the following table. The denominator of the fraction shall be determined based on the roof type, as follows:

| Â   | Roof Type                        | Numerator | Denominator |
| -- | -------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| a. | Built-up roof without insulation | 4         | 5           |
| b. | Built-up roof with insulation    | 4         | 5           |
| c. | Cement tile roof                 | 45        | 50          |
| d. | Asphalt shingle roof             | 14        | 15          |
| e. | Copper roof                      | Â          | Â            |
| f. | Wood shingle roof                | 9         | 10          |
| g. | All other types                  | 18        | 20          |

(b)âThe age of any component or structure for which the developer is required to fund a reserve account shall be measured in years from the later of:

1.âThe date when the component or structure was replaced or substantially renewed, if the replacement or renewal of the component at least met the requirements of the then-applicable building code; or

2.âThe date when the installation or construction of the existing component or structure was completed.

(c)âWhen the age of a component or structure is to be measured from the date of replacement or renewal, the developer shall provide the division with a certificate, under the seal of an architect or engineer authorized to practice in this state, verifying:

1.âThe date of the replacement or renewal; and

2.âThat the replacement or renewal at least met the requirements of the then-applicable building code.

(2)(a)âThe developer shall fund the reserve account required by subsection (1) on a pro rata basis upon the sale of each unit. The developer shall deposit in the reserve account not less than a percentage of the total amount to be deposited in the reserve account equal to the percentage of ownership of the common elements allocable to the unit sold. When a developer deposits amounts in excess of the minimum reserve account funding, later deposits may be reduced to the extent of the excess funding. For the purposes of this subsection, a unit is considered sold when a fee interest in the unit is transferred to a third party or the unit is leased for a period in excess of 5 years.

(b)âWhen an association makes an expenditure of reserve account funds before the developer has sold all units, the developer shall make a deposit in the reserve account. Such deposit shall be at least equal to that portion of the expenditure which would be charged against the reserve account deposit that would have been made for any such unit had the unit been sold. Such deposit may be reduced to the extent the developer has funded the reserve account in excess of the minimum reserve account funding required by this subsection. This paragraph applies only when the developer has funded reserve accounts as provided by paragraph (a).

(3)âThe use of reserve account funds is limited as follows:

(a)âReserve account funds may be spent prior to the assumption of control of the association by unit owners other than the developer; and

(b)âReserve account funds may be expended only for repair or replacement of the specific components for which the funds were deposited, unless, after assumption of control of the association by unit owners other than the developer, a determination is made by a three-fourths vote of all unit owners to expend the funds for other purposes.

(4)âThe developer shall establish the reserve account in the name of the association at a bank, savings and loan association, or trust company located in this state.

(5)âA developer may establish and fund additional reserve accounts.

(6)âA developer makes no implied warranties when existing improvements are converted to ownership as a residential cooperative and reserve accounts are funded in accordance with this section. As an alternative to establishing such reserve accounts, or when a developer fails to establish the reserve accounts in accordance with this section, the developer shall be deemed to have granted to the purchaser of each unit an implied warranty of fitness and merchantability for the purposes or uses intended as to the roof and structural components of the improvements; as to fireproofing and fire protection systems; and as to mechanical, electrical, and plumbing elements serving the improvements, except mechanical elements serving only one unit. The warranty shall be for a period beginning with the notice of intended conversion and continuing for 3 years thereafter, or the recording of the declaration to cooperative and continuing for 3 years thereafter, or 1 year after owners other than the developer obtain control of the association, whichever occurs last, but in no event more than 5 years.

(a)âThe warranty provided for in this section is conditioned upon routine maintenance being performed, unless the maintenance is an obligation of the developer or a developer-controlled association.

(b)âThe warranty shall inure to the benefit of each owner and successor owner.

(c)âExisting improvements converted to residential cooperative may be covered by an insured warranty program underwritten by an insurance company authorized to do business in this state, if such warranty program meets the minimum requirements of this chapter. To the degree that the warranty program does not meet the minimum requirements of this chapter, such requirements shall apply.

(7)âWhen a developer desires to post a surety bond, the developer shall, after notification to the buyer, acquire a surety bond issued by a company licensed to do business in this state, if such a bond is readily available in the open market, in an amount which would be equal to the total amount of all reserve accounts required under subsection (1), payable to the association.

(8)âThe amended provisions of this section do not affect a conversion of existing improvements when a developer has filed a notice of intended conversion and the documents required by s. [719.503](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.503) or s. [719.504](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.504), as applicable, with the division prior to October 1, 1994, provided:

(a)âThe documents are proper for filing purposes.

(b)âThe developer, not later than 6 months after such filing:

1.âCreates a cooperative for such filing in accordance with part I.

2.âGives a notice of intended conversion.

(1)âThe purposes of this chapter are to give statutory recognition to corporations not for profit that operate residential communities in this state, to provide procedures for operating homeownersâ associations, and to protect the rights of association members without unduly impairing the ability of such associations to perform their functions.

(2)âThe Legislature recognizes that it is not in the best interest of homeownersâ associations or the individual association members thereof to create or impose a bureau or other agency of state government to regulate the affairs of homeownersâ associations. However, in accordance with s. [720.311](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.311), the Legislature finds that homeownersâ associations and their individual members will benefit from an expedited alternative process for resolution of election and recall disputes and presuit mediation of other disputes involving covenant enforcement and authorizes the department to hear, administer, and determine these disputes as more fully set forth in this chapter. Further, the Legislature recognizes that certain contract rights have been created for the benefit of homeownersâ associations and members thereof before the effective date of this act and that ss. [720.301](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.301)-[720.407](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.407) are not intended to impair such contract rights, including, but not limited to, the rights of the developer to complete the community as initially contemplated.

(3)âThis chapter does not apply to:

(a)âA community that is composed of property primarily intended for commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential use; or

(b)âThe commercial or industrial parcels in a community that contains both residential parcels and parcels intended for commercial or industrial use.

(4)âThis chapter does not apply to any association that is subject to regulation under chapter 718, chapter 719, or chapter 721 or to any nonmandatory association formed under chapter 723, except to the extent that a provision of chapter 718, chapter 719, or chapter 721 is expressly incorporated into this chapter for the purpose of regulating homeownersâ associations.

(5)âUnless expressly stated to the contrary, corporations that operate residential homeownersâ associations in this state shall be governed by and subject to part I of chapter 607, if the association was incorporated under that part, or to chapter 617, if the association was incorporated under that chapter, and this chapter. This subsection is intended to clarify existing law.

# Chapter 720 Section 303 - 2023 Florida Statutes

Source: [https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0720.303](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0720.303)

720.303âAssociation powers and duties; meetings of board; official records; budgets; financial reporting; association funds; recalls.â

(1)âPOWERS AND DUTIES.âAn association which operates a community as defined in s. [720.301](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.301), must be operated by an association that is a Florida corporation. After October 1, 1995, the association must be incorporated and the initial governing documents must be recorded in the official records of the county in which the community is located. An association may operate more than one community. The officers and directors of an association have a fiduciary relationship to the members who are served by the association. The powers and duties of an association include those set forth in this chapter and, except as expressly limited or restricted in this chapter, those set forth in the governing documents. After control of the association is obtained by members other than the developer, the association may institute, maintain, settle, or appeal actions or hearings in its name on behalf of all members concerning matters of common interest to the members, including, but not limited to, the common areas; roof or structural components of a building, or other improvements for which the association is responsible; mechanical, electrical, or plumbing elements serving an improvement or building for which the association is responsible; representations of the developer pertaining to any existing or proposed commonly used facility; and protesting ad valorem taxes on commonly used facilities. The association may defend actions in eminent domain or bring inverse condemnation actions. Before commencing litigation against any party in the name of the association involving amounts in controversy in excess of $100,000, the association must obtain the affirmative approval of a majority of the voting interests at a meeting of the membership at which a quorum has been attained. This subsection does not limit any statutory or common-law right of any individual member or class of members to bring any action without participation by the association. A member does not have authority to act for the association by virtue of being a member. An association may have more than one class of members and may issue membership certificates. An association of 15 or fewer parcel owners may enforce only the requirements of those deed restrictions established prior to the purchase of each parcel upon an affected parcel owner or owners.

(2)âBOARD MEETINGS.â

(a)âMembers of the board of administration may use e-mail as a means of communication but may not cast a vote on an association matter via e-mail. A meeting of the board of directors of an association occurs whenever a quorum of the board gathers to conduct association business. Meetings of the board must be open to all members, except for meetings between the board and its attorney with respect to proposed or pending litigation where the contents of the discussion would otherwise be governed by the attorney-client privilege. A meeting of the board must be held at a location that is accessible to a physically handicapped person if requested by a physically handicapped person who has a right to attend the meeting. The provisions of this subsection shall also apply to the meetings of any committee or other similar body when a final decision will be made regarding the expenditure of association funds and to meetings of any body vested with the power to approve or disapprove architectural decisions with respect to a specific parcel of residential property owned by a member of the community.

(b)âMembers have the right to attend all meetings of the board. The right to attend such meetings includes the right to speak at such meetings with reference to all designated items. The association may adopt written reasonable rules expanding the right of members to speak and governing the frequency, duration, and other manner of member statements, which rules must be consistent with this paragraph and may include a sign-up sheet for members wishing to speak. Notwithstanding any other law, meetings between the board or a committee and the associationâs attorney to discuss proposed or pending litigation or meetings of the board held for the purpose of discussing personnel matters are not required to be open to the members other than directors.

(c)âThe bylaws shall provide the following for giving notice to parcel owners and members of all board meetings and, if they do not do so, shall be deemed to include the following:

1.âNotices of all board meetings must specifically identify agenda items for the meetings and must be posted in a conspicuous place in the community at least 48 hours in advance of a meeting, except in an emergency. In the alternative, if notice is not posted in a conspicuous place in the community, notice of each board meeting must be mailed or delivered to each member at least 7 days before the meeting, except in an emergency. Notwithstanding this general notice requirement, for communities with more than 100 members, the association bylaws may provide for a reasonable alternative to posting or mailing of notice for each board meeting, including publication of notice, provision of a schedule of board meetings, or the conspicuous posting and repeated broadcasting of the notice on a closed-circuit cable television system serving the homeownersâ association. However, if broadcast notice is used in lieu of a notice posted physically in the community, the notice must be broadcast at least four times every broadcast hour of each day that a posted notice is otherwise required. When broadcast notice is provided, the notice and agenda must be broadcast in a manner and for a sufficient continuous length of time so as to allow an average reader to observe the notice and read and comprehend the entire content of the notice and the agenda. In addition to any of the authorized means of providing notice of a meeting of the board, the association may, by rule, adopt a procedure for conspicuously posting the meeting notice and the agenda on the associationâs website or an application that can be downloaded on a mobile device for at least the minimum period of time for which a notice of a meeting is also required to be physically posted on the association property. Any rule adopted must, in addition to other matters, include a requirement that the association send an electronic notice to members whose e-mail addresses are included in the associationâs official records in the same manner as is required for a notice of a meeting of the members. Such notice must include a hyperlink to the website or such mobile application on which the meeting notice is posted. The association may provide notice by electronic transmission in a manner authorized by law for meetings of the board of directors, committee meetings requiring notice under this section, and annual and special meetings of the members to any member who has provided a facsimile number or e-mail address to the association to be used for such purposes; however, a member must consent in writing to receiving notice by electronic transmission.

2.âAn assessment may not be levied at a board meeting unless the notice of the meeting includes a statement that assessments will be considered and the nature of the assessments. Written notice of any meeting at which special assessments will be considered or at which amendments to rules regarding parcel use will be considered must be mailed, delivered, or electronically transmitted to the members and parcel owners and posted conspicuously on the property or broadcast on closed-circuit cable television not less than 14 days before the meeting.

3.âDirectors may not vote by proxy or by secret ballot at board meetings, except that secret ballots may be used in the election of officers. This subsection also applies to the meetings of any committee or other similar body, when a final decision will be made regarding the expenditure of association funds, and to any body vested with the power to approve or disapprove architectural decisions with respect to a specific parcel of residential property owned by a member of the community.

(d)âIf 20 percent of the total voting interests petition the board to address an item of business, the board shall at its next regular board meeting or at a special meeting of the board, but not later than 60 days after the receipt of the petition, take the petitioned item up on an agenda. The board shall give all members notice of the meeting at which the petitioned item shall be addressed in accordance with the 14-day notice requirement pursuant to subparagraph (c)2. Each member shall have the right to speak for at least 3 minutes on each matter placed on the agenda by petition, provided that the member signs the sign-up sheet, if one is provided, or submits a written request to speak prior to the meeting. Other than addressing the petitioned item at the meeting, the board is not obligated to take any other action requested by the petition.

(e)âAt the first board meeting, excluding the organizational meeting, which follows the annual meeting of the members, the board shall consider the desirability of filing notices to preserve the covenants or restrictions affecting the community or association from extinguishment under the Marketable Record Title Act, chapter 712, and to authorize and direct the appropriate officer to file notice in accordance with s. [720.3032](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.3032).

(3)âMINUTES.âMinutes of all meetings of the members of an association and of the board of directors of an association must be maintained in written form or in another form that can be converted into written form within a reasonable time. A vote or abstention from voting on each matter voted upon for each director present at a board meeting must be recorded in the minutes.

(4)âOFFICIAL RECORDS.âThe association shall maintain each of the following items, when applicable, which constitute the official records of the association:

(a)âCopies of any plans, specifications, permits, and warranties related to improvements constructed on the common areas or other property that the association is obligated to maintain, repair, or replace.

(b)âA copy of the bylaws of the association and of each amendment to the bylaws.

(c)âA copy of the articles of incorporation of the association and of each amendment thereto.

(d)âA copy of the declaration of covenants and a copy of each amendment thereto.

(e)âA copy of the current rules of the homeownersâ association.

(f)âThe minutes of all meetings of the board of directors and of the members, which minutes must be retained for at least 7 years.

(g)âA current roster of all members and their designated mailing addresses and parcel identifications. A memberâs designated mailing address is the memberâs property address, unless the member has sent written notice to the association requesting that a different mailing address be used for all required notices. The association shall also maintain the e-mail addresses and the facsimile numbers designated by members for receiving notice sent by electronic transmission of those members consenting to receive notice by electronic transmission. A memberâs e-mail address is the e-mail address the member provided when consenting in writing to receiving notice by electronic transmission, unless the member has sent written notice to the association requesting that a different e-mail address be used for all required notices. The e-mail addresses and facsimile numbers provided by members to receive notice by electronic transmission must be removed from association records when the member revokes consent to receive notice by electronic transmission. However, the association is not liable for an erroneous disclosure of the e-mail address or the facsimile number for receiving electronic transmission of notices.

(h)âAll of the associationâs insurance policies or a copy thereof, which policies must be retained for at least 7 years.

(i)âA current copy of all contracts to which the association is a party, including, without limitation, any management agreement, lease, or other contract under which the association has any obligation or responsibility. Bids received by the association for work to be performed must also be considered official records and must be kept for a period of 1 year.

(j)âThe financial and accounting records of the association, kept according to good accounting practices. All financial and accounting records must be maintained for a period of at least 7 years. The financial and accounting records must include:

1.âAccurate, itemized, and detailed records of all receipts and expenditures.

2.âA current account and a periodic statement of the account for each member, designating the name and current address of each member who is obligated to pay assessments, the due date and amount of each assessment or other charge against the member, the date and amount of each payment on the account, and the balance due.

3.âAll tax returns, financial statements, and financial reports of the association.

4.âAny other records that identify, measure, record, or communicate financial information.

(k)âA copy of the disclosure summary described in s. [720.401](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.401)(1).

(l)âBallots, sign-in sheets, voting proxies, and all other papers and electronic records relating to voting by parcel owners, which must be maintained for at least 1 year after the date of the election, vote, or meeting.

(m)âAll affirmative acknowledgments made pursuant to s. [720.3085](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.3085)(3)(c)3.

(n)âAll other written records of the association not specifically included in this subsection which are related to the operation of the association.

(5)âINSPECTION AND COPYING OF RECORDS.âThe official records shall be maintained within the state for at least 7 years and shall be made available to a parcel owner for inspection or photocopying within 45 miles of the community or within the county in which the association is located within 10 business days after receipt by the board or its designee of a written request. This subsection may be complied with by having a copy of the official records available for inspection or copying in the community or, at the option of the association, by making the records available to a parcel owner electronically via the Internet or by allowing the records to be viewed in electronic format on a computer screen and printed upon request. If the association has a photocopy machine available where the records are maintained, it must provide parcel owners with copies on request during the inspection if the entire request is limited to no more than 25 pages. An association shall allow a member or his or her authorized representative to use a portable device, including a smartphone, tablet, portable scanner, or any other technology capable of scanning or taking photographs, to make an electronic copy of the official records in lieu of the associationâs providing the member or his or her authorized representative with a copy of such records. The association may not charge a fee to a member or his or her authorized representative for the use of a portable device.

(a)âThe failure of an association to provide access to the records within 10 business days after receipt of a written request submitted by certified mail, return receipt requested, creates a rebuttable presumption that the association willfully failed to comply with this subsection.

(b)âA member who is denied access to official records is entitled to the actual damages or minimum damages for the associationâs willful failure to comply with this subsection. The minimum damages are to be $50 per calendar day up to 10 days, the calculation to begin on the 11th business day after receipt of the written request.

(c)âThe association may adopt reasonable written rules governing the frequency, time, location, notice, records to be inspected, and manner of inspections, but may not require a parcel owner to demonstrate any proper purpose for the inspection, state any reason for the inspection, or limit a parcel ownerâs right to inspect records to less than one 8-hour business day per month. The association may impose fees to cover the costs of providing copies of the official records, including the costs of copying and the costs required for personnel to retrieve and copy the records if the time spent retrieving and copying the records exceeds one-half hour and if the personnel costs do not exceed $20 per hour. Personnel costs may not be charged for records requests that result in the copying of 25 or fewer pages. The association may charge up to 25 cents per page for copies made on the associationâs photocopier. If the association does not have a photocopy machine available where the records are kept, or if the records requested to be copied exceed 25 pages in length, the association may have copies made by an outside duplicating service and may charge the actual cost of copying, as supported by the vendor invoice. The association shall maintain an adequate number of copies of the recorded governing documents, to ensure their availability to members and prospective members. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the following records are not accessible to members or parcel owners:

1.âAny record protected by the lawyer-client privilege as described in s. [90.502](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/90.502) and any record protected by the work-product privilege, including, but not limited to, a record prepared by an association attorney or prepared at the attorneyâs express direction which reflects a mental impression, conclusion, litigation strategy, or legal theory of the attorney or the association and which was prepared exclusively for civil or criminal litigation or for adversarial administrative proceedings or which was prepared in anticipation of such litigation or proceedings until the conclusion of the litigation or proceedings.

2.âInformation obtained by an association in connection with the approval of the lease, sale, or other transfer of a parcel.

3.âInformation an association obtains in a gated community in connection with guestsâ visits to parcel owners or community residents.

4.âPersonnel records of association or management company employees, including, but not limited to, disciplinary, payroll, health, and insurance records. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term âpersonnel recordsâ does not include written employment agreements with an association or management company employee or budgetary or financial records that indicate the compensation paid to an association or management company employee.

5.âMedical records of parcel owners or community residents.

6.âSocial security numbers, driver license numbers, credit card numbers, electronic mailing addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, emergency contact information, any addresses for a parcel owner other than as provided for association notice requirements, and other personal identifying information of any person, excluding the personâs name, parcel designation, mailing address, and property address. Notwithstanding the restrictions in this subparagraph, an association may print and distribute to parcel owners a directory containing the name, parcel address, and all telephone numbers of each parcel owner. However, an owner may exclude his or her telephone numbers from the directory by so requesting in writing to the association. An owner may consent in writing to the disclosure of other contact information described in this subparagraph. The association is not liable for the disclosure of information that is protected under this subparagraph if the information is included in an official record of the association and is voluntarily provided by an owner and not requested by the association.

7.âAny electronic security measure that is used by the association to safeguard data, including passwords.

8.âThe software and operating system used by the association which allows the manipulation of data, even if the owner owns a copy of the same software used by the association. The data is part of the official records of the association.

9.âAll affirmative acknowledgments made pursuant to s. [720.3085](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.3085)(3)(c)3.

(d)âThe association or its authorized agent is not required to provide a prospective purchaser or lienholder with information about the residential subdivision or the association other than information or documents required by this chapter to be made available or disclosed. The association or its authorized agent may charge a reasonable fee to the prospective purchaser or lienholder or the current parcel owner or member for providing good faith responses to requests for information by or on behalf of a prospective purchaser or lienholder, other than that required by law, if the fee does not exceed $150 plus the reasonable cost of photocopying and any attorney fees incurred by the association in connection with the response.

(6)âBUDGETS.â

(a)âThe association shall prepare an annual budget that sets out the annual operating expenses. The budget must reflect the estimated revenues and expenses for that year and the estimated surplus or deficit as of the end of the current year. The budget must set out separately all fees or charges paid for by the association for recreational amenities, whether owned by the association, the developer, or another person. The association shall provide each member with a copy of the annual budget or a written notice that a copy of the budget is available upon request at no charge to the member. The copy must be provided to the member within the time limits set forth in subsection (5).

(b)âIn addition to annual operating expenses, the budget may include reserve accounts for capital expenditures and deferred maintenance for which the association is responsible. If reserve accounts are not established pursuant to paragraph (d), funding of such reserves is limited to the extent that the governing documents limit increases in assessments, including reserves. If the budget of the association includes reserve accounts established pursuant to paragraph (d), such reserves shall be determined, maintained, and waived in the manner provided in this subsection. Once an association provides for reserve accounts pursuant to paragraph (d), the association shall thereafter determine, maintain, and waive reserves in compliance with this subsection. This section does not preclude the termination of a reserve account established pursuant to this paragraph upon approval of a majority of the total voting interests of the association. Upon such approval, the terminating reserve account shall be removed from the budget.

(c)1.âIf the budget of the association does not provide for reserve accounts under paragraph (d), or the declaration of covenants, articles, or bylaws do not obligate the developer to create reserves, and the association is responsible for the repair and maintenance of capital improvements that may result in a special assessment if reserves are not provided or not fully funded, each financial report for the preceding fiscal year required by subsection (7) must contain the following statement in conspicuous type:

THE BUDGET OF THE ASSOCIATION DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR FULLY FUNDED RESERVE ACCOUNTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT MAY RESULT IN SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS REGARDING THOSE ITEMS. OWNERS MAY ELECT TO PROVIDE FOR FULLY FUNDED RESERVE ACCOUNTS UNDER SECTION [720.303](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.303)(6), FLORIDA STATUTES, UPON OBTAINING THE APPROVAL OF A MAJORITY OF THE TOTAL VOTING INTERESTS OF THE ASSOCIATION BY VOTE OF THE MEMBERS AT A MEETING OR BY WRITTEN CONSENT.

2.âIf the budget of the association does provide for funding accounts for deferred expenditures, including, but not limited to, funds for capital expenditures and deferred maintenance, but such accounts are not created or established under paragraph (d), each financial report for the preceding fiscal year required under subsection (7) must also contain the following statement in conspicuous type:

THE BUDGET OF THE ASSOCIATION PROVIDES FOR LIMITED VOLUNTARY DEFERRED EXPENDITURE ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE, SUBJECT TO LIMITS ON FUNDING CONTAINED IN OUR GOVERNING DOCUMENTS. BECAUSE THE OWNERS HAVE NOT ELECTED TO PROVIDE FOR RESERVE ACCOUNTS UNDER SECTION [720.303](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.303)(6), FLORIDA STATUTES, THESE FUNDS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF SUCH FUNDS SET FORTH IN THAT STATUTE, NOR ARE RESERVES CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT STATUTE.

(d)âAn association is deemed to have provided for reserve accounts upon the affirmative approval of a majority of the total voting interests of the association. Such approval may be obtained by vote of the members at a duly called meeting of the membership or by the written consent of a majority of the total voting interests of the association. The approval action of the membership must state that reserve accounts shall be provided for in the budget and must designate the components for which the reserve accounts are to be established. Upon approval by the membership, the board of directors shall include the required reserve accounts in the budget in the next fiscal year following the approval and each year thereafter. Once established as provided in this subsection, the reserve accounts must be funded or maintained or have their funding waived in the manner provided in paragraph (f).

(e)âThe amount to be reserved in any account established shall be computed by means of a formula that is based upon estimated remaining useful life and estimated replacement cost or deferred maintenance expense of each reserve item. The association may adjust replacement reserve assessments annually to take into account any changes in estimates of cost or useful life of a reserve item.

(f)âAfter one or more reserve accounts are established, the membership of the association, upon a majority vote at a meeting at which a quorum is present, may provide for no reserves or less reserves than required by this section. If a meeting of the unit owners has been called to determine whether to waive or reduce the funding of reserves and such result is not achieved or a quorum is not present, the reserves as included in the budget go into effect. After the turnover, the developer may vote its voting interest to waive or reduce the funding of reserves. Any vote taken pursuant to this subsection to waive or reduce reserves is applicable only to one budget year.

(g)âFunding formulas for reserves authorized by this section must be based on a separate analysis of each of the required assets or a pooled analysis of two or more of the required assets.

1.âIf the association maintains separate reserve accounts for each of the required assets, the amount of the contribution to each reserve account is the sum of the following two calculations:

a.âThe total amount necessary, if any, to bring a negative component balance to zero.

b.âThe total estimated deferred maintenance expense or estimated replacement cost of the reserve component less the estimated balance of the reserve component as of the beginning of the period the budget will be in effect. The remainder, if greater than zero, shall be divided by the estimated remaining useful life of the component.

The formula may be adjusted each year for changes in estimates and deferred maintenance performed during the year and may include factors such as inflation and earnings on invested funds.

2.âIf the association maintains a pooled account of two or more of the required reserve assets, the amount of the contribution to the pooled reserve account as disclosed on the proposed budget may not be less than that required to ensure that the balance on hand at the beginning of the period the budget will go into effect plus the projected annual cash inflows over the remaining estimated useful life of all of the assets that make up the reserve pool are equal to or greater than the projected annual cash outflows over the remaining estimated useful lives of all the assets that make up the reserve pool, based on the current reserve analysis. The projected annual cash inflows may include estimated earnings from investment of principal and accounts receivable minus the allowance for doubtful accounts. The reserve funding formula may not include any type of balloon payments.

(h)âReserve funds and any interest accruing thereon shall remain in the reserve account or accounts and shall be used only for authorized reserve expenditures unless their use for other purposes is approved in advance by a majority vote at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Prior to turnover of control of an association by a developer to parcel owners, the developer-controlled association shall not vote to use reserves for purposes other than those for which they were intended without the approval of a majority of all nondeveloper voting interests voting in person or by limited proxy at a duly called meeting of the association.

(i)1.âWhile a developer is in control of a homeownersâ association, the developer may, but is not required to, include reserves in the budget. If the developer includes reserves in the budget, the developer may determine the amount of reserves included. The developer is not obligated to pay for:

a.âContributions to reserve accounts for capital expenditures and deferred maintenance, as well as any other reserves that the homeownersâ association or the developer may be required to fund pursuant to any state, municipal, county, or other governmental statute or ordinance;

b.âOperating expenses; or

c.âAny other assessments related to the developerâs parcels for any period of time for which the developer has provided in the declaration that in lieu of paying any assessments imposed on any parcel owned by the developer, the developer need only pay the deficit, if any, in any fiscal year of the association, between the total amount of the assessments receivable from other members plus any other association income and the lesser of the budgeted or actual expenses incurred by the association during such fiscal year.

2.âThis paragraph applies to all homeownersâ associations existing on or created after July 1, 2021.

(7)âFINANCIAL REPORTING.âWithin 90 days after the end of the fiscal year, or annually on the date provided in the bylaws, the association shall prepare and complete, or contract with a third party for the preparation and completion of, a financial report for the preceding fiscal year. Within 21 days after the final financial report is completed by the association or received from the third party, but not later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year or other date as provided in the bylaws, the association shall, within the time limits set forth in subsection (5), provide each member with a copy of the annual financial report or a written notice that a copy of the financial report is available upon request at no charge to the member. Financial reports shall be prepared as follows:

(a)âAn association that meets the criteria of this paragraph shall prepare or cause to be prepared a complete set of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as adopted by the Board of Accountancy. The financial statements shall be based upon the associationâs total annual revenues, as follows:

1.âAn association with total annual revenues of $150,000 or more, but less than $300,000, shall prepare compiled financial statements.

2.âAn association with total annual revenues of at least $300,000, but less than $500,000, shall prepare reviewed financial statements.

3.âAn association with total annual revenues of $500,000 or more shall prepare audited financial statements.

(b)1.âAn association with total annual revenues of less than $150,000 shall prepare a report of cash receipts and expenditures.

2.âA report of cash receipts and disbursement must disclose the amount of receipts by accounts and receipt classifications and the amount of expenses by accounts and expense classifications, including, but not limited to, the following, as applicable: costs for security, professional, and management fees and expenses; taxes; costs for recreation facilities; expenses for refuse collection and utility services; expenses for lawn care; costs for building maintenance and repair; insurance costs; administration and salary expenses; and reserves if maintained by the association.

(c)âIf 20 percent of the parcel owners petition the board for a level of financial reporting higher than that required by this section, the association shall duly notice and hold a meeting of members within 30 days of receipt of the petition for the purpose of voting on raising the level of reporting for that fiscal year. Upon approval of a majority of the total voting interests of the parcel owners, the association shall prepare or cause to be prepared, shall amend the budget or adopt a special assessment to pay for the financial report regardless of any provision to the contrary in the governing documents, and shall provide within 90 days of the meeting or the end of the fiscal year, whichever occurs later:

1.âCompiled, reviewed, or audited financial statements, if the association is otherwise required to prepare a report of cash receipts and expenditures;

2.âReviewed or audited financial statements, if the association is otherwise required to prepare compiled financial statements; or

3.âAudited financial statements if the association is otherwise required to prepare reviewed financial statements.

(d)âIf approved by a majority of the voting interests present at a properly called meeting of the association, an association may prepare or cause to be prepared:

1.âA report of cash receipts and expenditures in lieu of a compiled, reviewed, or audited financial statement;

2.âA report of cash receipts and expenditures or a compiled financial statement in lieu of a reviewed or audited financial statement; or

3.âA report of cash receipts and expenditures, a compiled financial statement, or a reviewed financial statement in lieu of an audited financial statement.

(8)âASSOCIATION FUNDS; COMMINGLING.â

(a)âAll association funds held by a developer shall be maintained separately in the associationâs name. Reserve and operating funds of the association shall not be commingled prior to turnover except the association may jointly invest reserve funds; however, such jointly invested funds must be accounted for separately.

(b)âNo developer in control of a homeownersâ association shall commingle any association funds with his or her funds or with the funds of any other homeownersâ association or community association.

(c)âAssociation funds may not be used by a developer to defend a civil or criminal action, administrative proceeding, or arbitration proceeding that has been filed against the developer or directors appointed to the association board by the developer, even when the subject of the action or proceeding concerns the operation of the developer-controlled association.

(d)âIf an association collects a deposit from a member for any reason, including to pay for expenses that may be incurred as a result of construction on a memberâs parcel, such funds must be maintained separately and may not be commingled with any other association funds. Upon completion of the memberâs construction project or other reason for which the deposit was collected, the member may request an accounting from the association of his or her funds that were deposited, and the association must provide such accounting to the member within 7 days after receiving the memberâs request. An association must remit payment of any unused funds to the member within 30 days after receiving notice that the memberâs construction project, or other reason for which the deposit was collected, is complete.

(9)âAPPLICABILITY.âSections [617.1601](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/617.1601)-[617.1604](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/617.1604) do not apply to a homeownersâ association in which the members have the inspection and copying rights set forth in this section.

(10)âRECALL OF DIRECTORS.â

(a)1.âRegardless of any provision to the contrary contained in the governing documents, subject to the provisions of s. [720.307](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.307) regarding transition of association control, any member of the board of directors may be recalled and removed from office with or without cause by a majority of the total voting interests.

2.âWhen the governing documents, including the declaration, articles of incorporation, or bylaws, provide that only a specific class of members is entitled to elect a board director or directors, only that class of members may vote to recall those board directors so elected.

(b)1.âBoard directors may be recalled by an agreement in writing or by written ballot without a membership meeting. The agreement in writing or the written ballots, or a copy thereof, shall be served on the association by certified mail or by personal service in the manner authorized by chapter 48 and the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.

2.âThe board shall duly notice and hold a meeting of the board within 5 full business days after receipt of the agreement in writing or written ballots. At the meeting, the board shall either certify the written ballots or written agreement to recall a director or directors of the board, in which case such director or directors shall be recalled effective immediately and shall turn over to the board within 5 full business days any and all records and property of the association in their possession, or proceed as described in paragraph (d).

3.âWhen it is determined by the department pursuant to binding arbitration proceedings or the court in an action filed in a court of competent jurisdiction that an initial recall effort was defective, written recall agreements or written ballots used in the first recall effort and not found to be defective may be reused in one subsequent recall effort. However, in no event is a written agreement or written ballot valid for more than 120 days after it has been signed by the member.

4.âAny rescission or revocation of a memberâs written recall ballot or agreement must be in writing and, in order to be effective, must be delivered to the association before the association is served with the written recall agreements or ballots.

5.âThe agreement in writing or ballot shall list at least as many possible replacement directors as there are directors subject to the recall, when at least a majority of the board is sought to be recalled; the person executing the recall instrument may vote for as many replacement candidates as there are directors subject to the recall.

(c)1.âIf the declaration, articles of incorporation, or bylaws specifically provide, the members may also recall and remove a board director or directors by a vote taken at a meeting. If so provided in the governing documents, a special meeting of the members to recall a director or directors of the board of administration may be called by 10 percent of the voting interests giving notice of the meeting as required for a meeting of members, and the notice shall state the purpose of the meeting. Electronic transmission may not be used as a method of giving notice of a meeting called in whole or in part for this purpose.

2.âThe board shall duly notice and hold a board meeting within 5 full business days after the adjournment of the member meeting to recall one or more directors. At the meeting, the board shall certify the recall, in which case such member or members shall be recalled effective immediately and shall turn over to the board within 5 full business days any and all records and property of the association in their possession, or shall proceed as set forth in paragraph (d).

(d)âIf the board determines not to certify the written agreement or written ballots to recall a director or directors of the board or does not certify the recall by a vote at a meeting, the board shall, within 5 full business days after the meeting, file an action with a court of competent jurisdiction or file with the department a petition for binding arbitration under the applicable procedures in ss. [718.112](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.112)(2)(l) and [718.1255](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.1255) and the rules adopted thereunder. For the purposes of this section, the members who voted at the meeting or who executed the agreement in writing shall constitute one party under the petition for arbitration or in a court action. If the arbitrator or court certifies the recall as to any director or directors of the board, the recall will be effective upon the final order of the court or the mailing of the final order of arbitration to the association. The director or directors so recalled shall deliver to the board any and all records of the association in their possession within 5 full business days after the effective date of the recall.

(e)âIf a vacancy occurs on the board as a result of a recall and less than a majority of the board directors are removed, the vacancy may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this subsection or in the association documents. If vacancies occur on the board as a result of a recall and a majority or more of the board directors are removed, the vacancies shall be filled by members voting in favor of the recall; if removal is at a meeting, any vacancies shall be filled by the members at the meeting. If the recall occurred by agreement in writing or by written ballot, members may vote for replacement directors in the same instrument in accordance with procedural rules adopted by the division, which rules need not be consistent with this subsection.

(f)âIf the board fails to duly notice and hold a board meeting within 5 full business days after service of an agreement in writing or within 5 full business days after the adjournment of the member recall meeting, the recall shall be deemed effective and the board directors so recalled shall immediately turn over to the board all records and property of the association.

(g)âIf the board fails to duly notice and hold the required meeting or fails to file the required petition or action, the parcel owner representative may file a petition or a court action under s. [718.1255](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.1255) challenging the boardâs failure to act. The petition or action must be filed within 60 days after the expiration of the applicable 5-full-business-day period. The review of a petition or action under this paragraph is limited to the sufficiency of service on the board and the facial validity of the written agreement or ballots filed.

(h)âIf a director who is removed fails to relinquish his or her office or turn over records as required under this section, the circuit court in the county where the association maintains its principal office may, upon the petition of the association, summarily order the director to relinquish his or her office and turn over all association records upon application of the association.

(i)âThe minutes of the board meeting at which the board decides whether to certify the recall are an official association record. The minutes must record the date and time of the meeting, the decision of the board, and the vote count taken on each board member subject to the recall. In addition, when the board decides not to certify the recall, as to each vote rejected, the minutes must identify the parcel number and the specific reason for each such rejection.

(j)âWhen the recall of more than one board director is sought, the written agreement, ballot, or vote at a meeting shall provide for a separate vote for each board director sought to be recalled.

(k)âA board member who has been recalled may file an action with a court of competent jurisdiction or a petition under ss. [718.112](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.112)(2)(l) and [718.1255](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.1255) and the rules adopted challenging the validity of the recall. The petition or action must be filed within 60 days after the recall is deemed certified. The association and the parcel owner representative shall be named as respondents.

(l)âThe division or a court of competent jurisdiction may not accept for filing a recall petition or action, whether filed under paragraph (b), paragraph (c), paragraph (g), or paragraph (k) and regardless of whether the recall was certified, when there are 60 or fewer days until the scheduled reelection of the board member sought to be recalled or when 60 or fewer days have not elapsed since the election of the board member sought to be recalled.

(11)âWINDSTORM INSURANCE.âWindstorm insurance coverage for a group of no fewer than three communities created and operating under chapter 718, chapter 719, this chapter, or chapter 721 may be obtained and maintained for the communities if the insurance coverage is sufficient to cover an amount equal to the probable maximum loss for the communities for a 250-year windstorm event. Such probable maximum loss must be determined through the use of a competent model that has been accepted by the Florida Commission on Hurricane Loss Projection Methodology. Such insurance coverage is deemed adequate windstorm coverage for purposes of this chapter.

(12)âCOMPENSATION PROHIBITED.âA director, officer, or committee member of the association may not directly receive any salary or compensation from the association for the performance of duties as a director, officer, or committee member and may not in any other way benefit financially from service to the association. This subsection does not preclude:

(a)âParticipation by such person in a financial benefit accruing to all or a significant number of members as a result of actions lawfully taken by the board or a committee of which he or she is a member, including, but not limited to, routine maintenance, repair, or replacement of community assets.

(b)âReimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such person on behalf of the association, subject to approval in accordance with procedures established by the associationâs governing documents or, in the absence of such procedures, in accordance with an approval process established by the board.

(c)âAny recovery of insurance proceeds derived from a policy of insurance maintained by the association for the benefit of its members.

(d)âAny fee or compensation authorized in the governing documents.

(e)âAny fee or compensation authorized in advance by a vote of a majority of the voting interests voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of the members.

(f)âA developer or its representative from serving as a director, officer, or committee member of the association and benefiting financially from service to the association.

720.3035âArchitectural control covenants; parcel owner improvements; rights and privileges.â

(1)âThe authority of an association or any architectural, construction improvement, or other such similar committee of an association to review and approve plans and specifications for the location, size, type, or appearance of any structure or other improvement on a parcel, or to enforce standards for the external appearance of any structure or improvement located on a parcel, shall be permitted only to the extent that the authority is specifically stated or reasonably inferred as to such location, size, type, or appearance in the declaration of covenants or other published guidelines and standards authorized by the declaration of covenants.

(2)âIf the declaration of covenants or other published guidelines and standards authorized by the declaration of covenants provides options for the use of material, the size of the structure or improvement, the design of the structure or improvement, or the location of the structure or improvement on the parcel, neither the association nor any architectural, construction improvement, or other such similar committee of the association shall restrict the right of a parcel owner to select from the options provided in the declaration of covenants or other published guidelines and standards authorized by the declaration of covenants.

(3)âUnless otherwise specifically stated in the declaration of covenants or other published guidelines and standards authorized by the declaration of covenants, each parcel shall be deemed to have only one front for purposes of determining the required front setback even if the parcel is bounded by a roadway or other easement on more than one side. When the declaration of covenants or other published guidelines and standards authorized by the declaration of covenants do not provide for specific setback limitations, the applicable county or municipal setback limitations shall apply, and neither the association nor any architectural, construction improvement, or other such similar committee of the association shall enforce or attempt to enforce any setback limitation that is inconsistent with the applicable county or municipal standard or standards.

(4)âEach parcel owner shall be entitled to the rights and privileges set forth in the declaration of covenants or other published guidelines and standards authorized by the declaration of covenants concerning the architectural use of the parcel, and the construction of permitted structures and improvements on the parcel and such rights and privileges shall not be unreasonably infringed upon or impaired by the association or any architectural, construction improvement, or other such similar committee of the association.

(c)âThis subsection applies to all community development districts and homeownersâ associations, regardless of whether such homeownersâ associations are authorized to impose assessments that may become a lien on the parcel.

(3)âAny owner prevented from exercising rights guaranteed by subsection (1) or subsection (2) may bring an action in the appropriate court of the county in which the alleged infringement occurred, and, upon favorable adjudication, the court shall enjoin the enforcement of any provision contained in any homeownersâ association document or rule that operates to deprive the owner of such rights.

(4)âIt is the intent of the Legislature to protect the right of parcel owners to exercise their rights to instruct their representatives and petition for redress of grievances before the various governmental entities of this state as protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and s. 5, Art. I of the State Constitution. The Legislature recognizes that âStrategic Lawsuits Against Public Participationâ or âSLAPPâ suits, as they are typically called, have occurred when members are sued by individuals, business entities, or governmental entities arising out of a parcel ownerâs appearance and presentation before a governmental entity on matters related to the homeownersâ association. However, it is the public policy of this state that government entities, business organizations, and individuals not engage in SLAPP suits because such actions are inconsistent with the right of parcel owners to participate in the stateâs institutions of government. Therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that prohibiting such lawsuits by governmental entities, business entities, and individuals against parcel owners who address matters concerning their homeownersâ association will preserve this fundamental state policy, preserve the constitutional rights of parcel owners, and assure the continuation of representative government in this state. It is the intent of the Legislature that such lawsuits be expeditiously disposed of by the courts.

(a)âAs used in this subsection, the term âgovernmental entityâ means the state, including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, the independent establishments of the state, counties, municipalities, districts, authorities, boards, or commissions, or any agencies of these branches which are subject to chapter 286.

(b)âA governmental entity, business organization, or individual in this state may not file or cause to be filed through its employees or agents any lawsuit, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, or counterclaim against a parcel owner without merit and solely because such parcel owner has exercised the right to instruct his or her representatives or the right to petition for redress of grievances before the various governmental entities of this state, as protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and s. 5, Art. I of the State Constitution.

(c)âA parcel owner sued by a governmental entity, business organization, or individual in violation of this section has a right to an expeditious resolution of a claim that the suit is in violation of this section. A parcel owner may petition the court for an order dismissing the action or granting final judgment in favor of that parcel owner. The petitioner may file a motion for summary judgment, together with supplemental affidavits, seeking a determination that the governmental entityâs, business organizationâs, or individualâs lawsuit has been brought in violation of this section. The governmental entity, business organization, or individual shall thereafter file its response and any supplemental affidavits. As soon as practicable, the court shall set a hearing on the petitionerâs motion, which shall be held at the earliest possible time after the filing of the governmental entityâs, business organizationâs or individualâs response. The court may award the parcel owner sued by the governmental entity, business organization, or individual actual damages arising from the governmental entityâs, individualâs, or business organizationâs violation of this section. A court may treble the damages awarded to a prevailing parcel owner and shall state the basis for the treble damages award in its judgment. The court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorneyâs fees and costs incurred in connection with a claim that an action was filed in violation of this section.

(d)âHomeownersâ associations may not expend association funds in prosecuting a SLAPP suit against a parcel owner.

(5)(a)âAny parcel owner may construct an access ramp if a resident or occupant of the parcel has a medical necessity or disability that requires a ramp for egress and ingress under the following conditions:

1.âThe ramp must be as unobtrusive as possible, be designed to blend in aesthetically as practicable, and be reasonably sized to fit the intended use.

2.âPlans for the ramp must be submitted in advance to the homeownersâ association. The association may make reasonable requests to modify the design to achieve architectural consistency with surrounding structures and surfaces.

(b)âThe parcel owner must submit to the association an affidavit from a physician attesting to the medical necessity or disability of the resident or occupant of the parcel requiring the access ramp. Certification used for s. [320.0848](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/320.0848) shall be sufficient to meet the affidavit requirement.

(6)âAny parcel owner may display a sign of reasonable size provided by a contractor for security services within 10 feet of any entrance to the home.

720.305âObligations of members; remedies at law or in equity; levy of fines and suspension of use rights.â

(1)âEach member and the memberâs tenants, guests, and invitees, and each association, are governed by, and must comply with, this chapter, the governing documents of the community, and the rules of the association. Actions at law or in equity, or both, to redress alleged failure or refusal to comply with these provisions may be brought by the association or by any member against:

(a)âThe association;

(b)âA member;

(c)âAny director or officer of an association who willfully and knowingly fails to comply with these provisions; and

(d)âAny tenants, guests, or invitees occupying a parcel or using the common areas.

The prevailing party in any such litigation is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs as provided in paragraph (2)(e). A member prevailing in an action between the association and the member under this section, in addition to recovering his or her reasonable attorney fees, may recover additional amounts as determined by the court to be necessary to reimburse the member for his or her share of assessments levied by the association to fund its expenses of the litigation. This relief does not exclude other remedies provided by law. This section does not deprive any person of any other available right or remedy.

(2)âAn association may levy reasonable fines for violations of the declaration, association bylaws, or reasonable rules of the association. A fine may not exceed $100 per violation against any member or any memberâs tenant, guest, or invitee for the failure of the owner of the parcel or its occupant, licensee, or invitee to comply with any provision of the declaration, the association bylaws, or reasonable rules of the association unless otherwise provided in the governing documents. A fine may be levied by the board for each day of a continuing violation, with a single notice and opportunity for hearing, except that the fine may not exceed $1,000 in the aggregate unless otherwise provided in the governing documents. A fine of less than $1,000 may not become a lien against a parcel. In any action to recover a fine, the prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs from the nonprevailing party as determined by the court.

(a)âAn association may suspend, for a reasonable period of time, the right of a member, or a memberâs tenant, guest, or invitee, to use common areas and facilities for the failure of the owner of the parcel or its occupant, licensee, or invitee to comply with any provision of the declaration, the association bylaws, or reasonable rules of the association. This paragraph does not apply to that portion of common areas used to provide access or utility services to the parcel. A suspension may not prohibit an owner or tenant of a parcel from having vehicular and pedestrian ingress to and egress from the parcel, including, but not limited to, the right to park.

(b)âA fine or suspension levied by the board of administration may not be imposed unless the board first provides at least 14 daysâ notice to the parcel owner at his or her designated mailing or e-mail address in the associationâs official records and, if applicable, any occupant, licensee, or invitee of the parcel owner, sought to be fined or suspended and a hearing before a committee of at least three members appointed by the board who are not officers, directors, or employees of the association, or the spouse, parent, child, brother, or sister of an officer, director, or employee. The notice must include a description of the alleged violation; the specific action required to cure such violation, if applicable; and the date and location of the hearing. A parcel owner has the right to attend a hearing by telephone or other electronic means.

(c)âIf the committee, by majority vote, does not approve a proposed fine or suspension, the proposed fine or suspension may not be imposed. The role of the committee is limited to determining whether to confirm or reject the fine or suspension levied by the board.

(d)âAfter the hearing, the committee shall provide written notice to the parcel owner at his or her designated mailing or e-mail address in the associationâs official records and, if applicable, any occupant, licensee, or invitee of the parcel owner, of the committeeâs findings related to the violation, including any applicable fines or suspensions that the committee approved or rejected, and how the parcel owner or any occupant, licensee, or invitee of the parcel owner may cure the violation, if applicable.

(e)âIf the proposed fine or suspension levied by the board is approved by the committee by a majority vote, the fine payment is due 5 days after notice of the approved fine required under paragraph (d) is provided to the parcel owner and, if applicable, to any occupant, licensee, or invitee of the parcel owner. The association must provide written notice of such fine or suspension by mail or hand delivery to the parcel owner and, if applicable, to any occupant, licensee, or invitee of the parcel owner.

(3)âIf a member is more than 90 days delinquent in paying any fee, fine, or other monetary obligation due to the association, the association may suspend the rights of the member, or the memberâs tenant, guest, or invitee, to use common areas and facilities until the fee, fine, or other monetary obligation is paid in full. This subsection does not apply to that portion of common areas used to provide access or utility services to the parcel. A suspension may not prohibit an owner or tenant of a parcel from having vehicular and pedestrian ingress to and egress from the parcel, including, but not limited to, the right to park. The notice and hearing requirements under subsection (2) do not apply to a suspension imposed under this subsection.

(4)âAn association may suspend the voting rights of a parcel or member for the nonpayment of any fee, fine, or other monetary obligation due to the association that is more than 90 days delinquent. A voting interest or consent right allocated to a parcel or member which has been suspended by the association shall be subtracted from the total number of voting interests in the association, which shall be reduced by the number of suspended voting interests when calculating the total percentage or number of all voting interests available to take or approve any action, and the suspended voting interests shall not be considered for any purpose, including, but not limited to, the percentage or number of voting interests necessary to constitute a quorum, the percentage or number of voting interests required to conduct an election, or the percentage or number of voting interests required to approve an action under this chapter or pursuant to the governing documents. The notice and hearing requirements under subsection (2) do not apply to a suspension imposed under this subsection. The suspension ends upon full payment of all obligations currently due or overdue to the association.

(5)âAll suspensions imposed under subsection (3) or subsection (4) must be approved at a properly noticed board meeting. Upon approval, the board must send written notice to the parcel owner and, if applicable, the parcelâs occupant, licensee, or invitee by mail or hand delivery to the parcel ownerâs designated mailing or e-mail address in the associationâs official records.

(6)âThe suspensions permitted by paragraph (2)(a) and subsections (3) and (4) apply to a member and, when appropriate, the memberâs tenants, guests, or invitees, even if the delinquency or failure that resulted in the suspension arose from less than all of the multiple parcels owned by a member.

(1)âIf an association fails to fill vacancies on the board of directors sufficient to constitute a quorum in accordance with the bylaws, any member may give notice of the memberâs intent to apply to the circuit court within whose jurisdiction the association lies for the appointment of a receiver to manage the affairs of the association. The form of the notice shall be as follows:

(1)âAll contracts as further described in this section or any contract that is not to be fully performed within 1 year after the making thereof for the purchase, lease, or renting of materials or equipment to be used by the association in accomplishing its purposes under this chapter or the governing documents, and all contracts for the provision of services, shall be in writing. If a contract for the purchase, lease, or renting of materials or equipment, or for the provision of services, requires payment by the association that exceeds 10 percent of the total annual budget of the association, including reserves, the association must obtain competitive bids for the materials, equipment, or services. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to require the association to accept the lowest bid.

(2)(a)1.âNotwithstanding the foregoing, contracts with employees of the association, and contracts for attorney, accountant, architect, community association manager, engineering, and landscape architect services are not subject to the provisions of this section.

2.âA contract executed before October 1, 2004, and any renewal thereof, is not subject to the competitive bid requirements of this section. If a contract was awarded under the competitive bid procedures of this section, any renewal of that contract is not subject to such competitive bid requirements if the contract contains a provision that allows the board to cancel the contract on 30 daysâ notice. Materials, equipment, or services provided to an association under a local government franchise agreement by a franchise holder are not subject to the competitive bid requirements of this section. A contract with a manager, if made by a competitive bid, may be made for up to 3 years. An association whose declaration or bylaws provide for competitive bidding for services may operate under the provisions of that declaration or bylaws in lieu of this section if those provisions are not less stringent than the requirements of this section.

(b)âNothing contained in this section is intended to limit the ability of an association to obtain needed products and services in an emergency.

(c)âThis section does not apply if the business entity with which the association desires to enter into a contract is the only source of supply within the county serving the association.

(d)âNothing contained in this section shall excuse a party contracting to provide maintenance or management services from compliance with s. [720.309](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.309).

720.306âMeetings of members; voting and election procedures; amendments.â

(1)âQUORUM; AMENDMENTS.â

(a)âUnless a lower number is provided in the bylaws, the percentage of voting interests required to constitute a quorum at a meeting of the members shall be 30 percent of the total voting interests. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter or in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, decisions that require a vote of the members must be made by the concurrence of at least a majority of the voting interests present, in person or by proxy, at a meeting at which a quorum has been attained. A meeting of the members must be held at a location that is accessible to a physically handicapped person if requested by a physically handicapped person who has a right to attend the meeting.

(b)âUnless otherwise provided in the governing documents or required by law, and other than those matters set forth in paragraph (c), any governing document of an association may be amended by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the voting interests of the association. Within 30 days after recording an amendment to the governing documents, the association shall provide copies of the amendment to the members. However, if a copy of the proposed amendment is provided to the members before they vote on the amendment and the proposed amendment is not changed before the vote, the association, in lieu of providing a copy of the amendment, may provide notice to the members that the amendment was adopted, identifying the official book and page number or instrument number of the recorded amendment and that a copy of the amendment is available at no charge to the member upon written request to the association. The copies and notice described in this paragraph may be provided electronically to those owners who previously consented to receive notice electronically. The failure to timely provide notice of the recording of the amendment does not affect the validity or enforceability of the amendment.

(c)âUnless otherwise provided in the governing documents as originally recorded or permitted by this chapter or chapter 617, an amendment may not materially and adversely alter the proportionate voting interest appurtenant to a parcel or increase the proportion or percentage by which a parcel shares in the common expenses of the association unless the record parcel owner and all record owners of liens on the parcels join in the execution of the amendment. For purposes of this section, a change in quorum requirements is not an alteration of voting interests. The merger or consolidation of one or more associations under a plan of merger or consolidation under part I of chapter 607 or chapter 617 is not a material or adverse alteration of the proportionate voting interest appurtenant to a parcel.

(d)âThe Legislature finds that the procurement of mortgagee consent to amendments that do not affect the rights or interests of mortgagees is an unreasonable and substantial logistical and financial burden on the parcel owners and that there is a compelling state interest in enabling the members of an association to approve amendments to the associationâs governing documents through legal means. Accordingly, and notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary:

1.âAs to any mortgage recorded on or after July 1, 2013, any provision in the associationâs governing documents that requires the consent or joinder of some or all mortgagees of parcels or any other portion of the associationâs common areas to amend the associationâs governing documents or for any other matter is enforceable only as to amendments to the associationâs governing documents that adversely affect the priority of the mortgageeâs lien or the mortgageeâs rights to foreclose its lien or that otherwise materially affect the rights and interests of the mortgagees.

2.âAs to mortgages recorded before July 1, 2013, any existing provisions in the associationâs governing documents requiring mortgagee consent are enforceable.

3.âIn securing consent or joinder, the association is entitled to rely upon the public records to identify the holders of outstanding mortgages. The association may use the address provided in the original recorded mortgage document, unless there is a different address for the holder of the mortgage in a recorded assignment or modification of the mortgage, which recorded assignment or modification must reference the official records book and page on which the original mortgage was recorded. Once the association has identified the recorded mortgages of record, the association shall, in writing, request of each parcel owner whose parcel is encumbered by a mortgage of record any information that the owner has in his or her possession regarding the name and address of the person to whom mortgage payments are currently being made. Notice shall be sent to such person if the address provided in the original recorded mortgage document is different from the name and address of the mortgagee or assignee of the mortgage as shown by the public record. The association is deemed to have complied with this requirement by making the written request of the parcel owners required under this subparagraph. Any notices required to be sent to the mortgagees under this subparagraph shall be sent to all available addresses provided to the association.

4.âAny notice to the mortgagees required under subparagraph 3. may be sent by a method that establishes proof of delivery, and any mortgagee who fails to respond within 60 days after the date of mailing is deemed to have consented to the amendment.

5.âFor those amendments requiring mortgagee consent on or after July 1, 2013, in the event mortgagee consent is provided other than by properly recorded joinder, such consent shall be evidenced by affidavit of the association recorded in the public records of the county in which the declaration is recorded.

6.âAny amendment adopted without the required consent of a mortgagee is voidable only by a mortgagee who was entitled to notice and an opportunity to consent. An action to void an amendment is subject to the statute of limitations beginning 5 years after the date of discovery as to the amendments described in subparagraph 1. and 5 years after the date of recordation of the certificate of amendment for all other amendments. This subparagraph applies to all mortgages, regardless of the date of recordation of the mortgage.

(e)âA proposal to amend the governing documents must contain the full text of the provision to be amended and may not be revised or amended by reference solely to the title or number. Proposed new language must be underlined, and proposed deleted language must be stricken. If the proposed change is so extensive that underlining and striking through language would hinder, rather than assist, the understanding of the proposed amendment, a notation must be inserted immediately preceding the proposed amendment in substantially the following form: âSubstantial rewording. See governing documents for current text.â An amendment to a governing document is effective when recorded in the public records of the county in which the community is located.

(f)âAn immaterial error or omission in the amendment process does not invalidate an otherwise properly adopted amendment.

(g)âA notice required under this section must be mailed or delivered to the address identified as the parcel ownerâs mailing address in the official records of the association as required under s. [720.303](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.303)(4), or electronically transmitted in a manner authorized by the association if the parcel owner has consented, in writing, to receive notice by electronic transmission.

(h)1.âExcept as otherwise provided in this paragraph, any governing document, or amendment to a governing document, that is enacted after July 1, 2021, and that prohibits or regulates rental agreements applies only to a parcel owner who acquires title to the parcel after the effective date of the governing document or amendment, or to a parcel owner who consents, individually or through a representative, to the governing document or amendment.

2.âNotwithstanding subparagraph 1., an association may amend its governing documents to prohibit or regulate rental agreements for a term of less than 6 months and may prohibit the rental of a parcel for more than three times in a calendar year, and such amendments shall apply to all parcel owners.

3.âThis paragraph does not affect the amendment restrictions for associations of 15 or fewer parcel owners under s. [720.303](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.303)(1).

4.âFor purposes of this paragraph, a change of ownership does not occur when a parcel owner conveys the parcel to an affiliated entity, when beneficial ownership of the parcel does not change, or when an heir becomes the parcel owner. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term âaffiliated entityâ means an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the parcel owner or that becomes a parent or successor entity by reason of transfer, merger, consolidation, public offering, reorganization, dissolution or sale of stock, or transfer of membership partnership interests. For a conveyance to be recognized as one made to an affiliated entity, the entity must furnish to the association a document certifying that this subparagraph applies and provide any organizational documents for the parcel owner and the affiliated entity which support the representations in the certificate, as requested by the association.

5.âFor purposes of this paragraph, a change of ownership does occur when, with respect to a parcel owner that is a business entity, every person that owned an interest in the real property at the time of the enactment of the amendment or rule conveys their interest in the real property to an unaffiliated entity.

(2)âANNUAL MEETING.âThe association shall hold a meeting of its members annually for the transaction of any and all proper business at a time, date, and place stated in, or fixed in accordance with, the bylaws. The election of directors, if one is required to be held, must be held at, or in conjunction with, the annual meeting or as provided in the governing documents.

(3)âSPECIAL MEETINGS.âSpecial meetings must be held when called by the board of directors or, unless a different percentage is stated in the governing documents, by at least 10 percent of the total voting interests of the association. Business conducted at a special meeting is limited to the purposes described in the notice of the meeting.

(4)âCONTENT OF NOTICE.âUnless law or the governing documents require otherwise, notice of an annual meeting need not include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Notice of a special meeting must include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.

(5)âNOTICE OF MEETINGS.âThe bylaws shall provide for giving notice to members of all member meetings, and if they do not do so shall be deemed to provide the following: The association shall give all parcel owners and members actual notice of all membership meetings, which shall be mailed, delivered, or electronically transmitted to the members not less than 14 days prior to the meeting. Evidence of compliance with this 14-day notice shall be made by an affidavit executed by the person providing the notice and filed upon execution among the official records of the association. In addition to mailing, delivering, or electronically transmitting the notice of any meeting, the association may, by reasonable rule, adopt a procedure for conspicuously posting and repeatedly broadcasting the notice and the agenda on a closed-circuit cable television system serving the association. When broadcast notice is provided, the notice and agenda must be broadcast in a manner and for a sufficient continuous length of time so as to allow an average reader to observe the notice and read and comprehend the entire content of the notice and the agenda.

(6)âRIGHT TO SPEAK.âMembers and parcel owners have the right to attend all membership meetings and to speak at any meeting with reference to all items opened for discussion or included on the agenda. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the governing documents or any rules adopted by the board or by the membership, a member and a parcel owner have the right to speak for at least 3 minutes on any item. The association may adopt written reasonable rules governing the frequency, duration, and other manner of member and parcel owner statements, which rules must be consistent with this subsection.

(7)âADJOURNMENT.âUnless the bylaws require otherwise, adjournment of an annual or special meeting to a different date, time, or place must be announced at that meeting before an adjournment is taken, or notice must be given of the new date, time, or place pursuant to s. [720.303](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.303)(2). Any business that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting may be transacted at the adjourned meeting. If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed under s. [607.0707](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/607.0707), notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to persons who are entitled to vote and are members as of the new record date but were not members as of the previous record date.

(8)âPROXY VOTING.âThe members have the right, unless otherwise provided in this subsection or in the governing documents, to vote in person or by proxy.

(a)âTo be valid, a proxy must be dated, must state the date, time, and place of the meeting for which it was given, and must be signed by the authorized person who executed the proxy. A proxy is effective only for the specific meeting for which it was originally given, as the meeting may lawfully be adjourned and reconvened from time to time, and automatically expires 90 days after the date of the meeting for which it was originally given. A proxy is revocable at any time at the pleasure of the person who executes it. If the proxy form expressly so provides, any proxy holder may appoint, in writing, a substitute to act in his or her place.

(b)âIf the governing documents permit voting by secret ballot by members who are not in attendance at a meeting of the members for the election of directors, such ballots must be placed in an inner envelope with no identifying markings and mailed or delivered to the association in an outer envelope bearing identifying information reflecting the name of the member, the lot or parcel for which the vote is being cast, and the signature of the lot or parcel owner casting that ballot. If the eligibility of the member to vote is confirmed and no other ballot has been submitted for that lot or parcel, the inner envelope shall be removed from the outer envelope bearing the identification information, placed with the ballots which were personally cast, and opened when the ballots are counted. If more than one ballot is submitted for a lot or parcel, the ballots for that lot or parcel shall be disqualified. Any vote by ballot received after the closing of the balloting may not be considered.

(9)âELECTIONS AND BOARD VACANCIES.â

(a)âElections of directors must be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the governing documents of the association. Except as provided in paragraph (b), all members of the association are eligible to serve on the board of directors, and a member may nominate himself or herself as a candidate for the board at a meeting where the election is to be held; provided, however, that if the election process allows candidates to be nominated in advance of the meeting, the association is not required to allow nominations at the meeting. An election is not required unless more candidates are nominated than vacancies exist. If an election is not required because there are either an equal number or fewer qualified candidates than vacancies exist, and if nominations from the floor are not required pursuant to this section or the bylaws, write-in nominations are not permitted and such qualified candidates shall commence service on the board of directors, regardless of whether a quorum is attained at the annual meeting. Except as otherwise provided in the governing documents, boards of directors must be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by eligible voters. Any challenge to the election process must be commenced within 60 days after the election results are announced.

(b)âA person who is delinquent in the payment of any fee, fine, or other monetary obligation to the association on the day that he or she could last nominate himself or herself or be nominated for the board may not seek election to the board, and his or her name shall not be listed on the ballot. A person serving as a board member who becomes more than 90 days delinquent in the payment of any fee, fine, or other monetary obligation to the association shall be deemed to have abandoned his or her seat on the board, creating a vacancy on the board to be filled according to law. For purposes of this paragraph, the term âany fee, fine, or other monetary obligationâ means any delinquency to the association with respect to any parcel. A person who has been convicted of any felony in this state or in a United States District or Territorial Court, or has been convicted of any offense in another jurisdiction which would be considered a felony if committed in this state, may not seek election to the board and is not eligible for board membership unless such felonâs civil rights have been restored for at least 5 years as of the date on which such person seeks election to the board. The validity of any action by the board is not affected if it is later determined that a person was ineligible to seek election to the board or that a member of the board is ineligible for board membership.

(c)âAny election dispute between a member and an association must be submitted to binding arbitration with the division or filed with a court of competent jurisdiction. Such proceedings that are submitted to binding arbitration with the division must be conducted in the manner provided by s. [718.1255](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.1255) and the procedural rules adopted by the division. Unless otherwise provided in the bylaws, any vacancy occurring on the board before the expiration of a term may be filled by an affirmative vote of the majority of the remaining directors, even if the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director. In the alternative, a board may hold an election to fill the vacancy, in which case the election procedures must conform to the requirements of the governing documents. Unless otherwise provided in the bylaws, a board member appointed or elected under this section is appointed for the unexpired term of the seat being filled. Filling vacancies created by recall is governed by s. [720.303](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.303)(10) and rules adopted by the division.

(10)âRECORDING.âAny parcel owner may tape record or videotape meetings of the board of directors and meetings of the members. The board of directors of the association may adopt reasonable rules governing the taping of meetings of the board and the membership.

With respect to homeownersâ associations:

(1)âMembers other than the developer are entitled to elect at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the homeownersâ association when the earlier of the following events occurs:

(c)âUpon the developer abandoning or deserting its responsibility to maintain and complete the amenities or infrastructure as disclosed in the governing documents. There is a rebuttable presumption that the developer has abandoned and deserted the property if the developer has unpaid assessments or guaranteed amounts under s. [720.308](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.308) for a period of more than 2 years;

(d)âUpon the developer filing a petition seeking protection under chapter 7 of the federal Bankruptcy Code;

(e)âUpon the developer losing title to the property through a foreclosure action or the transfer of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, unless the successor owner has accepted an assignment of developer rights and responsibilities first arising after the date of such assignment; or

(f)âUpon a receiver for the developer being appointed by a circuit court and not being discharged within 30 days after such appointment, unless the court determines within 30 days after such appointment that transfer of control would be detrimental to the association or its members.

For purposes of this section, the term âmembers other than the developerâ shall not include builders, contractors, or others who purchase a parcel for the purpose of constructing improvements thereon for resale.

(2)âMembers other than the developer are entitled to elect at least one member of the board of directors of the homeownersâ association if 50 percent of the parcels in all phases of the community which will ultimately be operated by the association have been conveyed to members other than the developer.

(3)âThe developer is entitled to elect at least one member of the board of directors of the homeownersâ association as long as the developer holds for sale in the ordinary course of business at least 5 percent of the parcels in all phases of the community. After the developer relinquishes control of the homeownersâ association, the developer may exercise the right to vote any developer-owned voting interests in the same manner as any other member, except for purposes of reacquiring control of the homeownersâ association or selecting the majority of the members of the board of directors.

(4)âAt the time the members are entitled to elect at least a majority of the board of directors of the homeownersâ association, the developer shall, at the developerâs expense, within no more than 90 days deliver the following documents to the board:

(a)âAll deeds to common property owned by the association.

(b)âThe original of the associationâs declarations of covenants and restrictions.

(c)âA certified copy of the articles of incorporation of the association.

(d)âA copy of the bylaws.

(i)âThe financial records of the association from the date of incorporation through the date of turnover.

(j)âAll association funds and control thereof.

(k)âAll tangible property of the association.

(l)âA copy of all contracts which may be in force with the association as one of the parties.

(m)âA list of the names and addresses and telephone numbers of all contractors, subcontractors, or others in the current employ of the association.

(n)âAny and all insurance policies in effect.

(o)âAny permits issued to the association by governmental entities.

(p)âAny and all warranties in effect.

(s)âAll other contracts in effect to which the association is a party.

(t)âThe financial records, including financial statements of the association, and source documents from the incorporation of the association through the date of turnover. The records shall be audited by an independent certified public accountant for the period from the incorporation of the association or from the period covered by the last audit, if an audit has been performed for each fiscal year since incorporation. All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and shall be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, as prescribed by the Board of Accountancy, pursuant to chapter 473. The certified public accountant performing the audit shall examine to the extent necessary supporting documents and records, including the cash disbursements and related paid invoices to determine if expenditures were for association purposes and the billings, cash receipts, and related records of the association to determine that the developer was charged and paid the proper amounts of assessments. This paragraph applies to associations with a date of incorporation after December 31, 2007.

(5)âThis section does not apply to a homeownersâ association in existence on the effective date of this act, or to a homeownersâ association, no matter when created, if such association is created in a community that is included in an effective development-of-regional-impact development order as of the effective date of this act, together with any approved modifications thereof.

(1)âIt is declared that the public policy of this state prohibits the inclusion or enforcement of certain types of clauses in homeownersâ association documents, including declaration of covenants, articles of incorporation, bylaws, or any other document of the association which binds members of the association, which either have the effect of or provide that:

(a)âA developer has the unilateral ability and right to make changes to the homeownersâ association documents after the transition of homeownersâ association control in a community from the developer to the nondeveloper members, as set forth in s. [720.307](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.307), has occurred.

(b)âA homeownersâ association is prohibited or restricted from filing a lawsuit against the developer, or the homeownersâ association is otherwise effectively prohibited or restricted from bringing a lawsuit against the developer.

(c)âAfter the transition of homeownersâ association control in a community from the developer to the nondeveloper members, as set forth in s. [720.307](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.307), has occurred, a developer is entitled to cast votes in an amount that exceeds one vote per residential lot.

Such clauses are declared null and void as against the public policy of this state.

(2)âThe public policy described in subsection (1) prohibits the inclusion or enforcement of such clauses created on or after the effective date of s. 3, chapter 98-261, Laws of Florida.

(3)âHomeownersâ association documents, including declarations of covenants, articles of incorporation, or bylaws, may not preclude the display of up to two portable, removable flags as described in s. [720.304](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.304)(2)(a) by property owners. However, all flags must be displayed in a respectful manner consistent with the requirements for the United States flag under 36 U.S.C. chapter 10.

(4)(a)âThe Legislature finds that the use of Florida-friendly landscaping and other water use and pollution prevention measures to conserve or protect the stateâs water resources serves a compelling public interest and that the participation of homeownersâ associations and local governments is essential to the stateâs efforts in water conservation and water quality protection and restoration.

(b)âHomeownersâ association documents, including declarations of covenants, articles of incorporation, or bylaws, may not prohibit or be enforced so as to prohibit any property owner from implementing Florida-friendly landscaping, as defined in s. [373.185](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/373.185), on his or her land or create any requirement or limitation in conflict with any provision of part II of chapter 373 or a water shortage order, other order, consumptive use permit, or rule adopted or issued pursuant to part II of chapter 373.

(5)âIt is declared the public policy of the state that prior to transition of control of a homeownersâ association in a community from the developer to the nondeveloper members, as set forth in s. [720.307](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.307), the right of the developer to amend the associationâs governing documents is subject to a test of reasonableness, which prohibits the developer from unilaterally making amendments to the governing documents that are arbitrary, capricious, or in bad faith; destroy the general plan of development; prejudice the rights of existing nondeveloper members to use and enjoy the benefits of common property; or materially shift economic burdens from the developer to the existing nondeveloper members.

(6)âAn association may extinguish a discriminatory restriction as provided in s. [712.065](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/712.065).

720.3085âPayment for assessments; lien claims.â

(1)âWhen authorized by the governing documents, the association has a lien on each parcel to secure the payment of assessments and other amounts provided for by this section. Except as otherwise set forth in this section, the lien is effective from and shall relate back to the date on which the original declaration of the community was recorded. However, as to first mortgages of record, the lien is effective from and after recording of a claim of lien in the public records of the county in which the parcel is located. This subsection does not bestow upon any lien, mortgage, or certified judgment of record on July 1, 2008, including the lien for unpaid assessments created in this section, a priority that, by law, the lien, mortgage, or judgment did not have before July 1, 2008.

(a)âTo be valid, a claim of lien must state the description of the parcel, the name of the record owner, the name and address of the association, the assessment amount due, and the due date. The claim of lien secures all unpaid assessments that are due and that may accrue subsequent to the recording of the claim of lien and before entry of a certificate of title, as well as interest, late charges, and reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred by the association incident to the collection process. The person making payment is entitled to a satisfaction of the lien upon payment in full.

(b)âBy recording a notice in substantially the following form, a parcel owner or the parcel ownerâs agent or attorney may require the association to enforce a recorded claim of lien against his or her parcel:

NOTICE OF CONTEST OF LIEN

TO: Â Â (Name and address of association)Â Â 

You are notified that the undersigned contests the claim of lien filed by you on Â , Â Â (year)Â Â , and recorded in Official Records Book Â  at page Â , of the public records of Â  County, Florida, and that the time within which you may file suit to enforce your lien is limited to 90 days following the date of service of this notice. Executed this Â  day of Â , Â Â (year)Â Â .

Signed: Â Â (Owner or Attorney)Â Â 

After the notice of a contest of lien has been recorded, the clerk of the circuit court shall mail a copy of the recorded notice to the association by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the address shown in the claim of lien or the most recent amendment to it and shall certify to the service on the face of the notice. Service is complete upon mailing. After service, the association has 90 days in which to file an action to enforce the lien and, if the action is not filed within the 90-day period, the lien is void. However, the 90-day period shall be extended for any length of time that the association is prevented from filing its action because of an automatic stay resulting from the filing of a bankruptcy petition by the parcel owner or by any other person claiming an interest in the parcel.

(c)âThe association may bring an action in its name to foreclose a lien for assessments in the same manner in which a mortgage of real property is foreclosed and may also bring an action to recover a money judgment for the unpaid assessments without waiving any claim of lien. The association is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneyâs fees incurred in an action to foreclose a lien or an action to recover a money judgment for unpaid assessments.

(d)âA release of lien must be in substantially the following form:

RELEASE OF LIEN

The undersigned lienor, in consideration of the final payment in the amount of $Â , hereby waives and releases its lien and right to claim a lien for unpaid assessments through Â , Â Â (year)Â Â , recorded in the Official Records Book Â  at Page Â , of the public records of Â  County, Florida, for the following described real property:

(PARCEL NO. Â  OR LOT AND BLOCK) OF Â Â (subdivision name)Â Â  SUBDIVISION AS SHOWN IN THE PLAT THEREOF, RECORDED AT PLAT BOOK Â , PAGE Â , OF THE OFFICIAL RECORDS OF Â  COUNTY, FLORIDA.

Â Â (or insert appropriate metes and bounds description here)Â Â 

Â Â (Signature of Authorized Agent)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Signature of Witness)Â Â 

Â Â (Print Name)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Print Name)Â Â 

Â Â (Signature of Witness)Â Â 

Â Â (Print Name)Â Â 

Sworn to (or affirmed) and subscribed before me this Â  day of Â , Â Â (year)Â Â , by Â Â (name of person making statement)Â Â .

Â Â (Signature of Notary Public)Â Â 

Â Â (Print, type, or stamp commissioned name of Notary Public)Â Â 

Personally Known Â  OR Produced Â  as identification.

(e)âIf the parcel owner remains in possession of the parcel after a foreclosure judgment has been entered, the court may require the parcel owner to pay a reasonable rent for the parcel. If the parcel is rented or leased during the pendency of the foreclosure action, the association is entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect the rent. The expenses of the receiver must be paid by the party who does not prevail in the foreclosure action.

(f)âThe association may purchase the parcel at the foreclosure sale and hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the parcel.

(2)(a)âA parcel owner, regardless of how his or her title to property has been acquired, including by purchase at a foreclosure sale or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, is liable for all assessments that come due while he or she is the parcel owner. The parcel ownerâs liability for assessments may not be avoided by waiver or suspension of the use or enjoyment of any common area or by abandonment of the parcel upon which the assessments are made.

(b)âA parcel owner is jointly and severally liable with the previous parcel owner for all unpaid assessments that came due up to the time of transfer of title. This liability is without prejudice to any right the present parcel owner may have to recover any amounts paid by the present owner from the previous owner. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term âprevious ownerâ shall not include an association that acquires title to a delinquent property through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure. The present parcel ownerâs liability for unpaid assessments is limited to any unpaid assessments that accrued before the association acquired title to the delinquent property through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure.

(c)âNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, the liability of a first mortgagee, or its successor or assignee as a subsequent holder of the first mortgage who acquires title to a parcel by foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure for the unpaid assessments that became due before the mortgageeâs acquisition of title, shall be the lesser of:

1.âThe parcelâs unpaid common expenses and regular periodic or special assessments that accrued or came due during the 12 months immediately preceding the acquisition of title and for which payment in full has not been received by the association; or

2.âOne percent of the original mortgage debt.

The limitations on first mortgagee liability provided by this paragraph apply only if the first mortgagee filed suit against the parcel owner and initially joined the association as a defendant in the mortgagee foreclosure action. Joinder of the association is not required if, on the date the complaint is filed, the association was dissolved or did not maintain an office or agent for service of process at a location that was known to or reasonably discoverable by the mortgagee.

(d)âAn association, or its successor or assignee, that acquires title to a parcel through the foreclosure of its lien for assessments is not liable for any unpaid assessments, late fees, interest, or reasonable attorneyâs fees and costs that came due before the associationâs acquisition of title in favor of any other association, as defined in s. [718.103](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.103) or s. [720.301](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.301)(9), which holds a superior lien interest on the parcel. This paragraph is intended to clarify existing law.

(3)âAssessments and installments on assessments that are not paid when due bear interest from the due date until paid at the rate provided in the declaration of covenants or the bylaws of the association, which rate may not exceed the rate allowed by law. If no rate is provided in the declaration or bylaws, interest accrues at the rate of 18 percent per year.

(a)âIf the declaration or bylaws so provide, the association may also charge an administrative late fee not to exceed the greater of $25 or 5 percent of the amount of each installment that is paid past the due date.

(b)âAny payment received by an association and accepted shall be applied first to any interest accrued, then to any administrative late fee, then to any costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in collection, and then to the delinquent assessment. This paragraph applies notwithstanding any restrictive endorsement, designation, or instruction placed on or accompanying a payment. A late fee is not subject to the provisions of chapter 687 and is not a fine. The foregoing is applicable notwithstanding s. [673.3111](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/673.3111), any purported accord and satisfaction, or any restrictive endorsement, designation, or instruction placed on or accompanying a payment. The preceding sentence is intended to clarify existing law.

(c)1.âIf an association sends out an invoice for assessments or a parcelâs statement of the account described in s. [720.303](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.303)(4)(j)2., the invoice for assessments or the parcelâs statement of account must be delivered to the parcel owner by first-class United States mail or by electronic transmission to the parcel ownerâs e-mail address maintained in the associationâs official records.

2.âBefore changing the method of delivery for an invoice for assessments or the statement of the account, the association must deliver a written notice of such change to each parcel owner. The written notice must be delivered to the parcel owner at least 30 days before the association sends the invoice for assessments or the statement of the account by the new delivery method. The notice must be sent by first-class United States mail to the owner at his or her last address as reflected in the associationâs records and, if such address is not the parcel address, must be sent by first-class United States mail to the parcel address. Notice is deemed to have been delivered upon mailing as required by this subparagraph.

3.âA parcel owner must affirmatively acknowledge his or her understanding that the association will change its method of delivery of the invoice for assessments or the statement of the account before the association may change the method of delivering an invoice for assessments or the statement of account. The parcel owner may make the affirmative acknowledgment electronically or in writing.

(d)âAn association may not require payment of attorney fees related to a past due assessment without first delivering a written notice of late assessment to the parcel owner which specifies the amount owed the association and provides the parcel owner an opportunity to pay the amount owed without the assessment of attorney fees. The notice of late assessment must be sent by first-class United States mail to the owner at his or her last address as reflected in the associationâs records and, if such address is not the parcel address, must also be sent by first-class United States mail to the parcel address. Notice is deemed to have been delivered upon mailing as required by this paragraph. A rebuttable presumption that an association mailed a notice in accordance with this paragraph is established if a board member, officer, or agent of the association, or a manager licensed under part VIII of chapter 468, provides a sworn affidavit attesting to such mailing. The notice must be in substantially the following form:

NOTICE OF LATE ASSESSMENT

RE: Parcel Â  of Â Â (name of association)Â Â 

The following amounts are currently due on your account to Â Â (name of association)Â Â , and must be paid within 30 days after the date of this letter. This letter shall serve as the associationâs notice to proceed with further collection action against your property no sooner than 30 days after the date of this letter, unless you pay in full the amounts set forth below:

TOTAL OUTSTANDINGÂ Â Â Â Â $Â .

\*Interest accrues at the rate of Â  percent per annum.

(4)âA homeownersâ association may not file a record of lien against a parcel for unpaid assessments unless a written notice or demand for past due assessments as well as any other amounts owed to the association pursuant to its governing documents has been made by the association. The written notice or demand must:

(a)âProvide the owner with 45 days following the date the notice is deposited in the mail to make payment for all amounts due, including, but not limited to, any attorneyâs fees and actual costs associated with the preparation and delivery of the written demand. The notice must be in substantially the following form:

Maintenance due Â Â (dates)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $Â .

Late fee, if applicableÂ Â Â Â Â $Â .

Other costsÂ Â Â Â Â $Â .

TOTAL OUTSTANDINGÂ Â Â Â Â $Â .

\*Interest accrues at the rate of Â  percent per annum.

(b)âBe sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and by first-class United States mail to the parcel owner at his or her last address as reflected in the records of the association, if the address is within the United States, and to the parcel owner subject to the demand at the address of the parcel if the ownerâs address as reflected in the records of the association is not the parcel address. If the address reflected in the records is outside the United States, then sending the notice to that address and to the parcel address by first-class United States mail is sufficient.

(5)âThe association may bring an action in its name to foreclose a lien for unpaid assessments secured by a lien in the same manner that a mortgage of real property is foreclosed and may also bring an action to recover a money judgment for the unpaid assessments without waiving any claim of lien. The action to foreclose the lien may not be brought until 45 days after the parcel owner has been provided notice of the associationâs intent to foreclose and collect the unpaid amount. The notice must be given in the manner provided in paragraph (4)(b), and the notice may not be provided until the passage of the 45 days required in paragraph (4)(a). The notice must be in substantially the following form:

DELINQUENT ASSESSMENT

This letter is to inform you a Claim of Lien has been filed against your property because you have not paid the Â Â (type of assessment)Â Â  assessment to Â Â (name of association)Â Â . The association intends to foreclose the lien and collect the unpaid amount within 45 days of this letter being provided to you.

You owe the interest accruing from Â Â (month/year)Â Â  to the present. As of the date of this letter, the total amount due with interest is $Â . All costs of any action and interest from this day forward will also be charged to your account.

Any questions concerning this matter should be directed to Â Â (insert name, addresses, and telephone numbers of association representative)Â Â .

(a)âThe association may recover any interest, late charges, costs, and reasonable attorneyâs fees incurred in a lien foreclosure action or in an action to recover a money judgment for the unpaid assessments.

(b)âThe time limitations in this subsection do not apply if the parcel is subject to a foreclosure action or forced sale of another party, or if an owner of the parcel is a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding.

(6)âIf after service of a summons on a complaint to foreclose a lien the parcel is not the subject of a mortgage foreclosure or a notice of tax certificate sale, the parcel owner is not a debtor in bankruptcy proceedings, or the trial of or trial docket for the lien foreclosure action is not set to begin within 30 days, the parcel owner may serve and file with the court a qualifying offer at any time before the entry of a foreclosure judgment. For purposes of this subsection, the term âqualifying offerâ means a written offer to pay all amounts secured by the lien of the association plus amounts accruing during the pendency of the offer. The parcel owner may make only one qualifying offer during the pendency of a foreclosure action. If a parcel becomes the subject of a mortgage foreclosure or a notice of tax certificate sale while a qualifying offer is pending, the qualifying offer becomes voidable at the election of the association. If the parcel owner becomes a debtor in bankruptcy proceedings while a qualifying offer is pending, the qualifying offer becomes void.

(a)âThe parcel owner shall deliver a copy of the filed qualifying offer to the associationâs attorney by hand delivery, obtaining a written receipt, or by certified mail, return receipt requested.

(b)âThe parcel ownerâs filing of the qualifying offer with the court stays the foreclosure action for the period stated in the qualifying offer, which may not exceed 60 days following the date of service of the qualifying offer and no sooner than 30 days before the date of trial, arbitration, or the beginning of the trial docket, whichever occurs first, to permit the parcel owner to pay the qualifying offer to the association plus any amounts accruing during the pendency of the offer.

(c)âThe qualifying offer must be in writing, be signed by all owners of the parcel and the spouse of any owner if the spouse resides in or otherwise claims a homestead interest in the parcel, be acknowledged by a notary public, and be in substantially the following form:

QUALIFYING OFFER\
AUTOMATIC STAY INVOKED\
PURSUANT TO F.S. [720.3085](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.3085)

I/We, \[Name(s) of Parcel Owner(s)], admit the following:

1.âThe total amount due the association is secured by the lien of the association.

2.âThe association is entitled to foreclose its claim of lien and obtain a foreclosure judgment for the total amount due if I/we breach this qualifying offer by failing to pay the amount due by the date specified in this qualifying offer.

3.âI/We will not permit the priority of the lien of the association or the amounts secured by the lien to be endangered.

4.âI/We hereby affirm that the date(s) by which the association will receive $ \[specify amount] as the total amount due is \[specify date, no later than 60 days after the date of service of the qualifying offer and at least 30 days before the trial or arbitration date], in the following amounts and dates:

5.âI/We hereby confirm that I/we have requested and have received from the homeownersâ association a breakdown and total of all sums due the association and that the amount offered above is equal to or greater than the total amount provided by the association.

6.âThis qualifying offer operates as a stay to all portions of the foreclosure action which seek to collect unpaid assessments as provided in s. [720.3085](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.3085).

Signed: Â Â (Signatures of all parcel owners and spouses, if any)Â Â 

Sworn to and subscribed this Â Â (date)Â Â  day of Â Â (month)Â Â , Â Â (year)Â Â , before the undersigned authority.

Notary Public: Â Â (Signature of notary public)Â Â 

If the parcel owner makes a qualifying offer under this subsection, the association may not add the cost of any legal fees incurred by the association within the period of the stay other than costs acquired in defense of a mortgage foreclosure action concerning the parcel, a bankruptcy proceeding in which the parcel owner is a debtor, or in response to filings by a party other than the association in the lien foreclosure action of the association.

(7)âIf the parcel owner breaches the qualifying offer, the stay shall be vacated and the association may proceed in its action to obtain a foreclosure judgment against the parcel and the parcel owners for the amount in the qualifying offer and any amounts accruing after the date of the qualifying offer.

(8)(a)âIf the parcel is occupied by a tenant and the parcel owner is delinquent in paying any monetary obligation due to the association, the association may demand that the tenant pay to the association the subsequent rental payments and continue to make such payments until all the monetary obligations of the parcel owner related to the parcel have been paid in full to the association and the association releases the tenant or until the tenant discontinues tenancy in the parcel.

1.âThe association must provide the tenant a notice, by hand delivery or United States mail, in substantially the following form:

Pursuant to section [720.3085](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.3085)(8), Florida Statutes, we demand that you make your rent payments directly to the homeownersâ association and continue doing so until the association notifies you otherwise.

Payment due the homeownersâ association may be in the same form as you paid your landlord and must be sent by United States mail or hand delivery to Â Â (full address)Â Â , payable to Â Â (name)Â Â .

Your obligation to pay your rent to the association begins immediately, unless you have already paid rent to your landlord for the current period before receiving this notice. In that case, you must provide the association written proof of your payment within 14 days after receiving this notice and your obligation to pay rent to the association would then begin with the next rental period.

Pursuant to section [720.3085](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.3085)(8), Florida Statutes, your payment of rent to the association gives you complete immunity from any claim for the rent by your landlord.

2.âA tenant is immune from any claim by the parcel owner related to the rent timely paid to the association after the association has made written demand.

(b)âIf the tenant paid rent to the landlord or parcel owner for a given rental period before receiving the demand from the association and provides written evidence to the association of having paid the rent within 14 days after receiving the demand, the tenant shall begin making rental payments to the association for the following rental period and shall continue making rental payments to the association to be credited against the monetary obligations of the parcel owner until the association releases the tenant or the tenant discontinues tenancy in the unit. The association shall, upon request, provide the tenant with written receipts for payments made. The association shall mail written notice to the parcel owner of the associationâs demand that the tenant pay monetary obligations to the association.

(c)âThe liability of the tenant may not exceed the amount due from the tenant to the tenantâs landlord. The tenant shall be given a credit against rents due to the landlord in the amount of assessments paid to the association.

(d)âThe association may issue notice under s. [83.56](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/83.56) and sue for eviction under ss. [83.59](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/83.59)-[83.625](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/83.625) as if the association were a landlord under part II of chapter 83 if the tenant fails to pay a monetary obligation. However, the association is not otherwise considered a landlord under chapter 83 and specifically has no obligations under s. [83.51](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/83.51).

(e)âThe tenant does not, by virtue of payment of monetary obligations, have any of the rights of a parcel owner to vote in any election or to examine the books and records of the association.

(f)âA court may supersede the effect of this subsection by appointing a receiver.

(1)âAny grant or reservation made by any document, and any contract that has a term greater than 10 years, that is made by an association before control of the association is turned over to the members other than the developer, and that provides for the operation, maintenance, or management of the association or common areas, must be fair and reasonable.

(2)âIf the governing documents provide for the cost of communications services as defined in s. [202.11](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/202.11), information services or Internet services obtained pursuant to a bulk contract shall be deemed an operating expense of the association. If the governing documents do not provide for such services, the board may contract for the services, and the cost shall be deemed an operating expense of the association but must be allocated on a per-parcel basis rather than a percentage basis, notwithstanding that the governing documents provide for other than an equal sharing of operating expenses. Any contract entered into before July 1, 2011, in which the cost of the service is not equally divided among all parcel owners may be changed by a majority of the voting interests present at a regular or special meeting of the association in order to allocate the cost equally among all parcels.

(a)âAny contract entered into by the board may be canceled by a majority of the voting interests present at the next regular or special meeting of the association, whichever occurs first. Any member may make a motion to cancel such contract, but if no motion is made or if such motion fails to obtain the required vote, the contract shall be deemed ratified for the term expressed therein.

(b)âAny contract entered into by the board must provide, and shall be deemed to provide if not expressly set forth therein, that a hearing-impaired or legally blind parcel owner who does not occupy the parcel with a non-hearing-impaired or sighted person, or a parcel owner who receives supplemental security income under Title XVI of the Social Security Act or food assistance as administered by the Department of Children and Families pursuant to s. [414.31](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/414.31), may discontinue the service without incurring disconnect fees, penalties, or subsequent service charges, and may not be required to pay any operating expenses charge related to such service for those parcels. If fewer than all parcel owners share the expenses of the communications services, information services, or Internet services, the expense must be shared by all participating parcel owners. The association may use the provisions of s. [720.3085](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/720.3085) to enforce payment by the parcel owners receiving such services.

(c)âA resident of any parcel, whether a tenant or parcel owner, may not be denied access to available franchised, licensed, or certificated cable or video service providers if the resident pays the provider directly for services. A resident or a cable or video service provider may not be required to pay anything of value in order to obtain or provide such service except for the charges normally paid for like services by residents of single-family homes located outside the community but within the same franchised, licensed, or certificated area, and except for installation charges agreed to between the resident and the service provider.

(1)âAny lease of recreational or other commonly used facilities serving a community, which lease is entered into by the association or its members before control of the homeownersâ association is turned over to the members other than the developer, must provide as follows:

(a)âThat the facilities may not be offered for sale unless the homeownersâ association has the option to purchase the facilities, provided the homeownersâ association meets the price and terms and conditions of the facility owner by executing a contract with the facility owner within 90 days, unless agreed to otherwise, from the date of mailing of the notice by the facility owner to the homeownersâ association. If the facility owner offers the facilities for sale, he or she shall notify the homeownersâ association in writing stating the price and the terms and conditions of sale.

(b)âIf a contract between the facility owner and the association is not executed within such 90-day period, unless extended by mutual agreement, then, unless the facility owner thereafter elects to offer the facilities at a price lower than the price specified in his or her notice to the homeownersâ association, he or she has no further obligations under this subsection, and his or her only obligation shall be as set forth in subsection (2).

(c)âIf the facility owner thereafter elects to offer the facilities at a price lower than the price specified in his or her notice to the homeownersâ association, the homeownersâ association will have an additional 10 days to meet the price and terms and condition of the facility owner by executing a contract.

(2)âIf a facility owner receives a bona fide offer to purchase the facilities that he or she intends to consider or make a counteroffer to, his or her only obligations shall be to notify the homeownersâ association that he or she has received an offer, to disclose the price and material terms and conditions upon which he or she would consider selling the facilities, and to consider any offer made by the homeownersâ association. The facility owner shall be under no obligation to sell to the homeownersâ association or to interrupt or delay other negotiations, and he or she shall be free at any time to execute a contract for the sale of the facilities to a party or parties other than the homeownersâ association.

(3)(a)âAs used in subsections (1) and (2), the term ânotifyâ means the placing of a notice in the United States mail addressed to the president of the homeownersâ association. Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the deposit of the notice in the United States mail.

(b)âAs used in subsection (1), the term âofferâ means any solicitation by the facility owner directed to the general public.

(4)âThis section does not apply to:

(a)âAny sale or transfer to a person who would be included within the table of descent and distribution if the facility owner were to die intestate.

(b)âAny transfer by gift, devise, or operation of law.

(c)âAny transfer by a corporation to an affiliate. As used herein, the term âaffiliateâ means any shareholder of the transferring corporation; any corporation or entity owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the transferring corporation; or any other corporation or entity owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by any shareholder of the transferring corporation.

(d)âAny transfer to a governmental or quasi-governmental entity.

(e)âAny conveyance of an interest in the facilities incidental to the financing of such facilities.

(f)âAny conveyance resulting from the foreclosure of a mortgage, deed of trust, or other instrument encumbering the facilities or any deed given in lieu of such foreclosure.

(g)âAny sale or transfer between or among joint tenants in common owning the facilities.

(h)âThe purchase of the facilities by a governmental entity under its powers of eminent domain.

(5)(a)âThe Legislature declares that the public policy of this state prohibits the inclusion or enforcement of escalation clauses in land leases or other leases for recreational facilities, land, or other commonly used facilities that serve residential communities, and such clauses are hereby declared void. For purposes of this section, an escalation clause is any clause in a lease which provides that the rental rate under the lease or agreement is to increase at the same percentage rate as any nationally recognized and conveniently available commodity or consumer price index.

(b)âThis public policy prohibits the inclusion of such escalation clauses in leases entered into after the effective date of this amendment.

(c)âThis section is inapplicable:

1.âIf the lessor is the Federal Government, this state, any political subdivision of this state, or any agency of a political subdivision of this state; or

2.âTo a homeownersâ association that is in existence on the effective date of this act, or to an association, no matter when created, if the association is created in a community that is included in an effective development-of-regional-impact development order as of the effective date of this act, together with any approved modifications thereto.

(6)âAn association may enter into agreements to acquire leaseholds, memberships, and other possessory or use interests in lands or facilities, including, but not limited to, country clubs, golf courses, marinas, submerged land, parking areas, conservation areas, and other recreational facilities. An association may enter into such agreements regardless of whether the lands or facilities are contiguous to the lands of the community or whether such lands or facilities are intended to provide enjoyment, recreation, or other use or benefit to the owners. All leaseholds, memberships, and other possessory or use interests existing or created at the time of recording the declaration must be stated and fully described in the declaration. Subsequent to recording the declaration, agreements acquiring leaseholds, memberships, or other possessory or use interests not entered into within 12 months after recording the declaration may be entered into only if authorized by the declaration as a material alteration or substantial addition to the common areas or association property. If the declaration is silent, any such transaction requires the approval of 75 percent of the total voting interests of the association. The declaration may provide that the rental, membership fees, operations, replacements, or other expenses are common expenses; impose covenants and restrictions concerning their use; and contain other provisions not inconsistent with this subsection. An association exercising its rights under this subsection may join with other associations that are part of the same development or with a master association responsible for the enforcement of shared covenants, conditions, and restrictions in carrying out the intent of this subsection. This subsection is intended to clarify law in existence before July 1, 2010.

[617.0830](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/617.0830), the board of directors, in response to damage or injury caused by or anticipated in connection with an emergency, as defined in s. [252.34](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/252.34)(4), for which a state of emergency is declared pursuant to s. [252.36](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/252.36) in the area encompassed by the association, may exercise the following powers:

(a)âConduct board meetings, committee meetings, elections, or membership meetings, in whole or in part, by telephone, real-time videoconferencing, or similar real-time electronic or video communication after notice of the meetings and board decisions is provided in as practicable a manner as possible, including via publication, radio, United States mail, the Internet, electronic transmission, public service announcements, conspicuous posting on the common area, or any other means the board deems appropriate under the circumstances. Notice of decisions may also be communicated as provided in this paragraph.

(b)âCancel and reschedule an association meeting.

(c)âDesignate assistant officers who are not directors. If the executive officer is incapacitated or unavailable, the assistant officer has the same authority during the state of emergency as the executive officer he or she assists.

(e)âEnter into agreements with counties and municipalities to assist counties and municipalities with debris removal.

(h)âBased upon the advice of emergency management officials or public health officials or upon the advice of licensed professionals retained by or otherwise available to the board, determine whether the common areas or facilities can be safely inhabited, accessed, or occupied.

(i)âMitigate further damage, injury, or contagion, including taking action to contract for the removal of debris and to prevent or mitigate the spread of fungus, including mold or mildew, by removing and disposing of wet drywall, insulation, carpet, cabinetry, or other fixtures on or within the common areas or facilities or sanitizing the common areas or facilities.

(j)âNotwithstanding a provision to the contrary, and regardless of whether such authority does not specifically appear in the declaration or other recorded governing documents, levy special assessments without a vote of the owners.

(k)âWithout ownersâ approval, borrow money and pledge association assets as collateral to fund emergency repairs and carry out the duties of the association if operating funds are insufficient. This paragraph does not limit the general authority of the association to borrow money, subject to such restrictions contained in the declaration or other recorded governing documents.

(2)âThe authority granted under subsection (1) is limited to that time reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the association and the parcel owners and their family members, tenants, guests, agents, or invitees, and to mitigate further damage, injury, or contagion and make emergency repairs.

(3)âNotwithstanding paragraphs (1)(f)-(i), during a state of emergency declared by executive order or proclamation of the Governor pursuant to s.

(1)âThe division shall, upon receiving a filed public offering statement from a developer, mail to the developer an acknowledgment of receipt. The failure of the division to send such acknowledgment will not, however, relieve the developer from the duty of complying with this section.

(2)(a)âWithin 45 days after receipt of a filed public offering statement which is subject only to this part and is submitted in proper form as prescribed by rule, or within 120 days after receipt of a filed public offering statement which is subject to part II and is submitted in proper form as prescribed by rule, the division shall determine whether the proposed filed public offering statement is adequate to meet the requirements of this section and shall notify the developer by mail that the division has either approved the statement or found specified deficiencies in the statement.

(b)âIf the developer fails to respond to any cited deficiencies within 20 days after receipt of the divisionâs deficiency notice, the division may reject the filing. Subsequent to such rejection, a new filing fee pursuant to subsection (4) and a new division initial review period pursuant to paragraph (a) shall apply to any refiling or further review of the rejected filing.

(c)âWithin 20 days after receipt of the developerâs timely and complete response to any deficiency notice, the division shall notify the developer by mail that the division has either approved the filing, found additional specified deficiencies in it, or determined that any previously specified deficiency has not been corrected. If the division fails to approve or specify additional deficiencies within 20 days after receipt of the developerâs timely and complete response, the filing will be deemed approved.

(d)âA developer shall have the authority to deliver to purchasers any purchaser public offering statement that is not yet approved by the division, provided that the following shall apply:

1.âAt the time the developer delivers an unapproved purchaser public offering statement to a purchaser pursuant to this paragraph, the developer shall deliver a fully completed and executed copy of the purchase contract required by s.

Any revisions to the unapproved public offering statement you have received must be delivered to you, but only if the revisions materially alter or modify the offering in a manner adverse to you. After the division approves the public offering statement, you will receive notice of the approval from the developer and the required revisions, if any.

Your statutory right to cancel this transaction without any penalty or obligation expires 10 calendar days after the date you signed your purchase contract or the date on which you receive the last of all documents required to be given to you pursuant to section [721.07](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.07)(6), Florida Statutes, or 10 calendar days after you receive revisions required to be delivered to you, if any, whichever is later.

Your notice of cancellation shall be effective upon the date sent and shall be sent to Â Â (Name of Seller)Â Â  at Â Â (Address of Seller)Â Â .

The unapproved public offering statement previously delivered to you has been approved by the Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes. Revisions made to the unapproved public offering statement, if any, are not required to be delivered to you or are not deemed by the developer, in its opinion, to materially alter or modify the offering in a manner that is adverse to you. Accordingly, your cancellation right expired 10 days after you signed your purchase contract.

An escrow agent shall maintain the accounts called for in this section only in such a manner as to be under the direct supervision and control of the escrow agent. The escrow agent shall have a fiduciary duty to each purchaser to maintain the escrow accounts in accordance with good accounting practices and to release the purchaserâs funds or other property from escrow only in accordance with this chapter. The escrow agent shall retain all affidavits received pursuant to this section for a period of 5 years. Should the escrow agent receive conflicting demands for funds or other property held in escrow, the escrow agent shall immediately notify the division of the dispute and either promptly submit the matter to arbitration or, by interpleader or otherwise, seek an adjudication of the matter by court.

(2)âOne hundred percent of all funds or other property which is received from or on behalf of purchasers of the timeshare plan or timeshare interest prior to the occurrence of events required in this subsection shall be deposited pursuant to an escrow agreement approved by the division.

Such refund shall be made within 20 days after demand therefor by the purchaser or within 5 days after receipt of funds from the purchaserâs cleared check, whichever is later. If the purchaser has received benefits under the contract prior to the effective date of the cancellation, the funds or other property to be returned to the purchaser may be reduced by the proportion of contract benefits actually received.

(b)âPurchaserâs default.âFollowing expiration of the 10-day cancellation period, if the purchaser defaults in the performance of her or his obligations under the terms of the contract to purchase or such other agreement by which a seller sells the timeshare interest, the developer shall provide an affidavit to the escrow agent requesting release of the escrowed funds or other property and shall provide a copy of such affidavit to the purchaser who has defaulted.

The laws of the State of Florida govern the offering of this timeshare plan in this state. There are inherent risks in purchasing a timeshare interest in this timeshare plan because the accommodations and facilities of the timeshare plan are located on a vessel that will sail into international waters and into waters governed by many different jurisdictions.

Such refund shall be made in the manner prescribed for refunds under s. [721.10](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.10).

(7)âNotwithstanding the provisions of s. [721.05](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.05)(7)(b), a seller may portray possible accommodations or facilities to prospective purchasers in advertising material, or a purchaser public offering statement, without such accommodations or facilities being available for use by purchasers so long as the advertising material or purchaser public offering statement complies with the provisions of subsection (4).

[721.05](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.05)(7)(b), a developer may portray possible accommodations or facilities to prospective purchasers by disseminating oral or written statements regarding same to broadcast or print media with no obligation on the developerâs part to actually construct such accommodations or facilities or to file such accommodations or facilities with the division, but only so long as such oral or written statements are not considered advertising material pursuant to paragraph (3)(e).

(9)âNotwithstanding the provisions of s. [721.05](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.05)(7)(b), a seller of a multisite timeshare plan may portray a possible component site to prospective purchasers with no accommodations or facilities located at such component site being available for use by purchasers so long as the seller satisfies the following requirements:

(b)âA seller may make representations to purchasers in advertising material or in a purchaser public offering statement regarding the possible accommodations and facilities of a possible component site without such accommodations or facilities being available for use by purchasers so long as the advertising material or purchaser public offering statement complies with the provisions of subsection (4).

(c)âIn the event a seller makes any of the representations permitted by paragraph (b), the purchase agreement must contain the following conspicuous disclosure unless and until such time as the developer has committed itself in the timeshare instrument to adding the possible component site to the multisite timeshare plan, at which time the seller may portray the component site pursuant to the timeshare instrument without restriction:

\[Description of possible component site] is only a possible component site which may never be added to the multisite timeshare plan (or multisite vacation ownership plan or multisite vacation plan or vacation club). Do not purchase an interest in the multisite timeshare plan (or multisite vacation ownership plan or multisite vacation plan or vacation club) in reliance upon the addition of this component site.

(d)âNotwithstanding anything contained in this chapter to the contrary, a developer or managing entity may communicate with existing purchasers regarding possible component sites without restriction, so long as all oral and written statements made to existing purchasers pursuant to this subsection comply with the provisions of subsection (4).

(e)âAny violation of this subsection by a developer, seller, or managing entity shall constitute a violation of this chapter.

(1)âUnless the timeshare instrument provides otherwise, the vote or written consent, or both, of 60 percent of all voting interests in a timeshare plan may terminate the term of the timeshare plan at any time. If a timeshare plan is terminated pursuant to this section, the termination has immediate effect pursuant to applicable law and the timeshare instrument as if the effective date of the termination were the original date of termination.

(2)âIf a termination vote or consent pursuant to subsection (1) is proposed for a component site of a multisite timeshare plan located in this state, the proposed termination is effective only if the person authorized to make additions or substitutions of accommodations and facilities pursuant to the timeshare instrument also approves the termination.

(3)(a)âIf the timeshare property is managed by an ownersâ association that is separate from any underlying condominium, cooperative, or homeownersâ association, the termination of a timeshare plan does not change the corporate status of the ownersâ association. The ownersâ association continues to exist only for the purposes of concluding its affairs, prosecuting and defending actions by or against it, collecting and discharging obligations, disposing of and conveying its property, collecting and dividing its assets, and otherwise complying with this subsection.

1.âAfter termination of a timeshare plan, the board of administration of the ownersâ association shall serve as the termination trustee, and in such fiduciary capacity may bring an action in partition on behalf of the tenants in common in each former timeshare property or sell the former timeshare property in any manner and to any person who is approved by a majority of all such tenants in common.

The voting representative may vote on all matters at meetings of the condominium or cooperative association, including termination of the condominium or cooperative.

(1)âIf timeshare estates are being sold to purchasers of a timeshare plan, any contract between the ownersâ association and a manager or management firm shall be automatically renewable every 3 years, beginning with the third year after the ownersâ association is first created, unless the purchasers vote to discharge the manager or management firm. Such a vote shall be conducted by the board of administration of the ownersâ association. The manager or management firm shall be deemed discharged if at least 66 percent of the purchasers voting, which shall be at least 50 percent of all votes allocated to purchasers, vote to discharge.

(2)âIn the event the manager or management firm is discharged, the board of administration of the ownersâ association shall remain responsible for operating and maintaining the timeshare plan pursuant to the timeshare instrument and s. [721.13](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.13)(1).

At least 30 days before applying to the circuit court, the timeshare owner shall mail to the ownersâ association and post in a conspicuous place on the timeshare property a notice describing the intended action. If a receiver is appointed, the ownersâ association shall be responsible as a common expense of the timeshare plan, for payment of the salary and expenses of the receiver, relating to the discharge of her or his duties and obligations as receiver, together with the receiverâs court costs, and reasonable attorneyâs fees. The receiver shall have all powers and duties of a duly constituted board of administration and shall serve until discharged by the circuit court.

(4)(a)âAn ownersâ association and a manager or management firm may, in the management contract or other written document, agree to the transition procedures and related time periods to be followed in the event the manager or management firm is discharged pursuant to this section. If there is no written agreement between the parties that covers the matters set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c), the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) shall apply.

(b)âWithin 90 days after the date that the manager or management firm is notified by the ownersâ association of a successful termination vote pursuant to subsection (1), the terminated managing entity shall transfer to the ownersâ association or new manager or management firm all relevant data held by the managing entity and related to any reservation system for the timeshare plan, including, but not limited to:

721.15âAssessments for common expenses.â

(1)(a)âUntil a managing entity is created or provided pursuant to s. [721.13](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.13), the developer shall pay all common expenses. The timeshare instrument shall provide for the allocation of common expenses among all timeshare units or timeshare interests on a reasonable basis, including timeshare interests owned or not yet sold by the developer. The timeshare instrument may provide that the common expenses allocated may differ between those timeshare units that are part of the timeshare plan and those units that are not part of the timeshare plan; however, the different proportion of expenses must be based upon reasonable differences in the benefit provided to each. The timeshare instrument shall allocate common expenses to timeshare interests owned or not yet sold by the developer on the same basis that common expenses are allocated to similar or equivalent timeshare interests sold to purchasers.

(b)âNotwithstanding any provision of chapter 718 or chapter 719 to the contrary, the allocation of total common expenses for a condominium or a cooperative timeshare plan may vary on any reasonable basis, including, but not limited to, timeshare unit size, timeshare unit type, timeshare unit location, specific identification, or a combination of these factors, if the percentage interest in the common elements attributable to each timeshare condominium parcel or timeshare cooperative parcel equals the share of the total common expenses allocable to that parcel. The share of a timeshare interest in the common expenses allocable to the timeshare condominium parcel or the timeshare cooperative parcel containing such interest may vary on any reasonable basis if the timeshare interestâs share of its parcelâs common expense allocation is equal to that timeshare interestâs share of the percentage interest in common elements attributable to such parcel.

(2)(a)âAfter the creation or provision of a managing entity, the managing entity shall make an annual assessment against each purchaser for the payment of common expenses, based on the projected annual budget, in the amount specified by the contract between the seller and the purchaser or in the timeshare instrument.

(b)âNo owner of a timeshare interest may be excused from the payment of her or his share of the common expenses unless all owners are likewise excused from payment, except that the developer may be excused from the payment of her or his share of the common expenses which would have been assessed against her or his timeshare interests during a stated period of time during which the developer has guaranteed to each purchaser in the timeshare instrument, or by agreement between the developer and a majority of the owners of timeshare interests other than the developer, that the assessment for common expenses imposed upon the owners would not increase over a stated dollar amount. In the event of such a guarantee, the developer is obligated to pay all common expenses incurred during the guarantee period in excess of the total revenues of the timeshare plan. Notwithstanding this limitation, if a developer-controlled ownersâ association has maintained all insurance coverages required by s. [721.165](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.165), the common expenses incurred during the guarantee period resulting from a natural disaster or an act of God, which are not covered by insurance proceeds from the insurance maintained by the ownersâ association, may be assessed against all purchasers owning timeshare interests on the date of such natural disaster or act of God, and their successors and assigns, including the developer with respect to timeshare interests owned by the developer. In the event of such an assessment, all timeshare interests shall be assessed in accordance with their ownership interest as required by paragraph (1)(a).

(c)âFor the purpose of calculating the obligation of a developer under a guarantee pursuant to paragraph (b), amounts expended for any insurance coverage required by law or by the timeshare instrument to be maintained by the ownersâ association and depreciation expenses related to real property shall be excluded from common expenses incurred during the guarantee period, except that for real property that is used for the production of fees, revenues, or other income, depreciation expenses shall be excluded only to the extent that they exceed the net income from the production of such fees, revenues, or other income. Any special assessment imposed for amounts excluded from the developer guarantee pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid proportionately by all owners of timeshare interests, including the developer with respect to the timeshare interests owned by the developer, in accordance with the timeshare instrument.

(d)âA guarantee pursuant to paragraph (b) may provide that the developer may extend or increase the guarantee for one or more additional stated periods.

(3)âDelinquent assessments may bear interest at the highest rate permitted by law or at some lesser rate established by the managing entity. In addition to such interest, the managing entity may charge an administrative late fee in an amount not to exceed $25 for each delinquent assessment. Any costs of collection, including reasonable collection agency fees and reasonable attorneyâs fees, incurred in the collection of a delinquent assessment shall be paid by the purchaser and shall be secured by a lien in favor of the managing entity upon the timeshare interest with respect to which the delinquent assessment has been incurred; however, in the event that a managing entity turns the matter over to a collection agency, the managing entity must advise the purchaser at least 60 days prior to turning the matter over to the collection agency that the purchaser may be liable for the fees of the collection agency and that a lien may result therefrom.

(4)âUnless otherwise specified in the contract between the seller and the purchaser, any common expenses benefiting fewer than all purchasers shall be assessed only against those purchasers benefited.

(5)âAny assessments for common expenses which have not been spent for common expenses during the year for which such assessments were made shall be shown as an item on the annual budget.

(6)âNotwithstanding any contrary requirements of s. [718.112](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.112)(2)(i) or s. [719.106](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.106)(1)(g), for timeshare plans subject to this chapter, assessments against purchasers need not be made more frequently than annually.

(7)(a)âA purchaser, regardless of how her or his timeshare estate or timeshare license has been acquired, including a purchaser at a judicial sale, is personally liable for all assessments for common expenses which come due while the purchaser is the owner of such interest. A successor in interest is jointly and severally liable with her or his predecessor in interest for all unpaid assessments against such predecessor up to the time of transfer of the timeshare interest to such successor without prejudice to any right a successor in interest may have to recover from her or his predecessor in interest any amounts assessed against such predecessor and paid by such successor. The predecessor in interest or his or her agent, or a person providing resale transfer services for the predecessor in interest pursuant to s. [721.17](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.17)(3) or his or her agent, shall deliver to the managing entity a copy of the recorded deed of conveyance if the interest is a timeshare estate or a copy of the instrument of transfer if the interest is a timeshare license, with the name and mailing address of the successor in interest within 15 days after the date of transfer, and after such delivery the successor in interest shall be listed by the managing entity as the owner of the timeshare interest on the books and records of the timeshare plan. The managing entity shall not be liable to any person for any inaccuracy in the books and records of the timeshare plan arising from the failure of the predecessor in interest to timely and correctly notify the managing entity of the name and mailing address of the successor in interest.

(b)âWithin 30 days after receiving a written request from a timeshare interest owner, an agent designated in writing by the timeshare interest owner, or a person providing resale transfer services for a consumer timeshare reseller pursuant to s. [721.17](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.17)(3), a managing entity must provide a certificate, signed by an officer or agent of the managing entity, to the person requesting the certificate, that states the amount of any assessment, transfer fee, or other moneys currently owed to the managing entity, and of any assessment, transfer fee, or other moneys approved by the managing entity that will be due within the next 90 days, with respect to the designated consumer resale timeshare interest, as well as any information contained in the books and records of the timeshare plan regarding the legal description and use plan related to the designated consumer resale timeshare interest.

1.âA person who relies upon such certificate shall be protected thereby.

2.âA summary proceeding pursuant to s. [51.011](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/51.011) may be brought to compel compliance with this paragraph, and in such an action the prevailing party may recover reasonable attorney fees and court costs.

3.âThe managing entity may charge a fee not to exceed $150 for the preparation and delivery of the certificate. The amount of the fee must be included on the certificate.

(8)âNotwithstanding the provisions of subsection (7), a first mortgagee or its successor or assignee who acquires title to a timeshare interest as a result of the foreclosure of the mortgage or by deed in lieu of foreclosure of the mortgage shall be exempt from liability for all unpaid assessments attributable to the timeshare interest or chargeable to the previous owner which came due prior to acquisition of title by the first mortgagee.

(9)(a)âAnything contained in chapter 718 or chapter 719 to the contrary notwithstanding, the managing entity of a timeshare plan shall not commingle operating funds with reserve funds; however, the managing entity may maintain operating and reserve funds within a single account for a period not to exceed 30 days after the date on which the managing entity received payment of such funds.

(b)âAnything contained in chapter 718 or chapter 719 to the contrary notwithstanding, a managing entity which serves as managing entity of more than one timeshare plan, or of more than one component site pursuant to part II, shall not commingle the common expense funds of any one timeshare plan or component site with the common expense funds of any other timeshare plan or component site. However, the managing entity may maintain common expense funds of multiple timeshare plans or multiple component sites within a single account for a period not to exceed 30 days after the date on which the managing entity received payment of such funds.

(10)âThis section shall not apply to personal property timeshare plans.

(11)âNotwithstanding any provision of chapter 718 or chapter 719 to the contrary, any determination by a timeshare association of whether assessments exceed 115 percent of assessments for the prior fiscal year shall exclude anticipated expenses for insurance coverage required by law or by the timeshare instrument to be maintained by the association.

(1)âThe managing entity has a lien on a timeshare interest for any assessment levied against that timeshare interest from the date such assessment becomes due. The managing entity also has a lien on a timeshare interest of any purchaser for the cost of any maintenance, repairs, or replacement resulting from an act of such purchaser or purchaserâs guest that results in damage to the timeshare property or facilities made available to the purchasers.

(2)âThe managing entity may bring a judicial action in its name to foreclose a lien under subsection (1) in the manner a mortgage of real property is foreclosed and may also bring an action to recover a money judgment for the unpaid assessments without waiving any claim of lien. As an alternative to initiating a judicial action, the managing entity may initiate a trustee procedure to foreclose an assessment lien under s. [721.855](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.855).

(3)âThe lien is effective from the date of recording a claim of lien in the official records of the county or counties in which the timeshare interest is located. The claim of lien shall state the name of the timeshare plan and identify the timeshare interest for which the lien is effective, state the name of the purchaser, state the assessment amount due, and state the due dates. Notwithstanding any provision of s. [718.116](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.116)(5) or s. [719.108](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.108)(4) to the contrary, the lien is effective until satisfied or until 5 years have expired after the date the claim of lien is recorded unless, within that time, an action to enforce the lien is commenced pursuant to subsection (2). A claim of lien for assessments may include only assessments which are due when the claim is recorded. A claim of lien shall be signed and acknowledged by an officer or agent of the managing entity.

SECTION 53\
Subordination instruments; alternate security arrangements.

721.53âSubordination instruments; alternate security arrangements.â

(1)âWith respect to each accommodation or facility of a multisite timeshare plan, the developer shall provide the division with satisfactory evidence that one of the following has occurred with respect to each interestholder prior to offering the accommodation or facility as a part of the multisite timeshare plan:

(a)âThe interestholder has executed and recorded a nondisturbance and notice to creditors instrument pursuant to s. [721.08](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.08).

(b)âThe interestholder has executed a subordination and notice to creditors instrument and recorded it among the appropriate public records in the jurisdiction in which the subject accommodation or facility is located. The subordination instrument shall expressly subordinate the interest or lien of the interestholder in the subject accommodation or facility to the rights of purchasers of the multisite timeshare plan created with respect to such accommodation or facility by the timeshare instrument, and shall provide that:

1.âIf the party seeking enforcement is not in default of its obligations, the instrument may be enforced by both the seller and any purchaser of the multisite timeshare plan;

2.âThe instrument shall be effective as between the timeshare purchaser and interestholder despite any rejection or cancellation of the contract between the timeshare purchaser and developer as a result of bankruptcy proceedings of the developer; and

3.âSo long as a purchaser remains in good standing with respect to her or his obligations under the timeshare instrument, including making all payments to the managing entity required by the timeshare instrument with respect to the annual common expenses of the multisite timeshare plan, then the interestholder will honor all rights of such purchaser relating to the subject accommodation or facility as reflected in the timeshare instrument.

The subordination instrument shall also contain language sufficient to provide subsequent creditors of the developer and the interestholder with notice of the existence of the timeshare plan and of the rights of purchasers and shall serve to protect the interest of the timeshare purchasers from any claims of such subsequent creditors.

(c)âThe interestholder has transferred the subject accommodation or facility or all use rights therein to a nonprofit organization or ownersâ association to be held for the use and benefit of the purchasers, which entity shall act as a fiduciary to the purchasers. Prior to such transfer, any lien or other encumbrance against such accommodation or facility shall be made subject to a subordination and notice to creditors instrument pursuant to either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b). No transfer pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective until the nonprofit organization or ownersâ association accepts such transfer and the responsibilities set forth in subsection (2).

(d)âThe subject accommodation or facility is free and clear of the claims of any interestholder, and the purchasersâ rights in and to the subject accommodation or facility as described in and limited by the timeshare instrument are protected by a recorded instrument against the claims of any subsequent creditors of any owner of the underlying fee.

(e)âThe interestholder has transferred the subject accommodation or facility or all use rights therein to a trust that complies with this paragraph. If the accommodation or facility included in such transfer is subject to a lease, the unexpired term of the lease must be disclosed as the term of that component site pursuant to s. [721.55](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.55)(4)(a). Prior to such transfer, any lien or other encumbrance against such accommodation or facility shall be made subject to a nondisturbance and notice to creditors instrument pursuant to paragraph (a) or a subordination and notice to creditors instrument pursuant to paragraph (b). No transfer pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective until the trust accepts such transfer and the responsibilities set forth herein. A trust established pursuant to this paragraph shall comply with the following provisions:

1.âThe trustee shall be an individual or a business entity authorized and qualified to conduct trust business in this state. Any corporation authorized to do business in this state may act as trustee in connection with a timeshare plan pursuant to this chapter. The trustee must be independent from any developer or managing entity of the timeshare plan or any interestholder of any accommodation or facility of such plan. The same trustee may hold the accommodations and facilities, or use rights therein, for one or more of the component sites of the timeshare plan.

2.âThe trust shall be irrevocable so long as any purchaser has a right to occupy any portion of the timeshare property pursuant to the timeshare plan.

3.âThe trustee shall not convey, hypothecate, mortgage, assign, lease, or otherwise transfer or encumber in any fashion any interests in or portion of the timeshare property with respect to which any purchaser has a right of use or occupancy unless the timeshare plan is terminated pursuant to the timeshare instrument, or the timeshare property held in trust is deleted from a multisite timeshare plan pursuant to s. [721.552](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.552)(3), or such conveyance, hypothecation, mortgage, assignment, lease, transfer, or encumbrance is approved by vote of two-thirds of all voting interests of the timeshare plan. Subject to s. [721.552](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.552), a vote of the voting interests of the timeshare plan is not required for substitution or automatic deletion of accommodations or facilities.

4.âAll purchasers of the timeshare plan or the ownersâ association of the timeshare plan shall be express beneficiaries of the trust. The trustee shall act as a fiduciary to the beneficiaries of the trust. The personal liability of the trustee shall be governed by ss. [736.08125](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/736.08125), [736.08163](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/736.08163), [736.1013](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/736.1013), and [736.1015](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/736.1015). The agreement establishing the trust shall set forth the duties of the trustee. The trustee shall be required to furnish promptly to the division upon request a copy of the complete list of the names and addresses of the owners in the timeshare plan and a copy of any other books and records of the timeshare plan required to be maintained pursuant to s. [721.13](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.13) that are in the possession of the trustee. All expenses reasonably incurred by the trustee in the performance of its duties, together with any reasonable compensation of the trustee, shall be common expenses of the timeshare plan.

5.âThe trustee shall not resign upon less than 90 daysâ prior written notice to the managing entity and the division. No resignation shall become effective until a substitute trustee, approved by the division, is appointed by the managing entity and accepts the appointment.

6.âThe documents establishing the trust arrangement shall constitute a part of the timeshare instrument.

7.âFor trusts holding property in component sites located outside this state, the trust holding such property shall be deemed in compliance with the requirements of this paragraph, if such trust is authorized and qualified to conduct trust business under the laws of such jurisdiction and the agreement or law governing such trust arrangement provides substantially similar protections for the purchaser as are required in this paragraph for trusts holding property in a component site located in this state.

8.âThe trustee shall have appointed a registered agent in this state for service of process. In the event such a registered agent is not appointed, service of process may be served pursuant to s. [721.265](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.265).

(f)âWith respect to any personal property accommodations or facilities, the developer and any other interestholder have complied fully with the applicable provisions of s. [721.08](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.08).

(2)âThe nonprofit organization or ownersâ association described in paragraph (1)(c) shall comply with the following provisions:

(a)âThe nonprofit organization or ownersâ association shall not convey, hypothecate, mortgage, assign, or otherwise transfer or encumber in any fashion any portion of the timeshare property with respect to which any purchaser has a right of use or occupancy unless the timeshare plan is terminated pursuant to the timeshare instrument or the timeshare property held by the entity is deleted from a multisite timeshare plan pursuant to s. [721.552](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.552)(3).

(b)âThe nonprofit organization or ownersâ association shall notify the division and the managing entity of the multisite timeshare plan of any proposed transfer of the accommodations or facilities or use rights therein which is permitted by paragraph (a) at least 30 days prior to said transfer.

(c)âAll expenses reasonably incurred by the nonprofit organization or ownersâ association in the performance of its duties, pursuant to paragraph (a), shall be common expenses of the timeshare plan.

(3)âIn lieu of the requirements of subsection (1) or subsection (2), the director of the division may accept other assurances from the developer with respect to the subject accommodation or facility, including, but not limited to, a surety or fidelity bond or an irrevocable letter of credit, based upon the value of the subject accommodation or facility as established by independent appraisal or other evidence acceptable to the director.

721.552âAdditions, substitutions, or deletions of component site accommodations or facilities; purchaser remedies for violations.âAdditions, substitutions, or deletions of component site accommodations or facilities may be made only in accordance with the following:

(1)âADDITIONS.â

(a)âThe timeshare instrument must provide for:

1.âThe basis upon which new accommodations and facilities may be added to the multisite timeshare plan; by whom additions may be made; and the anticipated effect of the addition of new accommodations and facilities upon the reservation system, its priorities, its rules and regulations, and the availability of existing accommodations and facilities.

2.âAny cap on annual increases in common expenses of the multisite timeshare plan that would apply in the event that additional accommodations and facilities are made a part of the plan.

3.âThe extent, if any, to which purchasers of the multisite timeshare plan will have the right to consent to any proposed additions.

(b)âAny person who is authorized by the timeshare instrument to make additions to the multisite timeshare plan pursuant to this subsection shall act as a fiduciary in such capacity in the best interests of the purchasers of the plan as a whole and shall adhere to the demand balancing standard set forth in s. [721.56](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.56)(6) in connection with such additions. Additions that are otherwise permitted may be made only so long as a one-to-one use right to use night requirement ratio is maintained at all times.

(2)âSUBSTITUTIONS.â

(a)âSubstitutions are available only for nonspecific multisite timeshare plans. Specific multisite timeshare plans may not contain an accommodation substitution right.

(b)âThe timeshare instrument shall provide for the following:

1.âThe basis upon which new accommodations and facilities may be substituted for existing accommodations and facilities of the multisite timeshare plan; by whom substitutions may be made; and the basis upon which the determination may be made to cause such substitutions to occur.

2.âThe replacement accommodations and facilities must provide purchasers with an opportunity to enjoy a substantially similar or improved vacation experience as compared to the experience available at the replaced accommodation or facility. In determining whether the replacement accommodations and facilities will provide a substantially similar or improved vacation experience, all relevant factors must be considered, including, but not limited to, some or all of the following: size, capacity, furnishings, maintenance, location (geographic, topographic, and scenic), demand, and availability for purchaser use, and recreational capabilities.

3.âThe extent, if any, to which purchasers will have the right to consent to any proposed substitutions.

(c)âNo substitutions may be made during the first year after the developer begins to offer the multisite timeshare plan.

(d)1.âIf the timeshare instrument provides that the developer, acting unilaterally, is the person authorized to make substitutions, the developer may not substitute available accommodations in the multisite timeshare plan in a given calendar year pursuant to paragraph (e) if the amount of such substituted accommodations provides more than 10 percent of the total annual use availability in the multisite timeshare plan calculated in 7-day increments.

2.âIf the timeshare instrument provides that the managing entity is the person authorized to make substitutions, and the managing entity is under common ownership or control with the developer, the managing entity may not substitute available accommodations in the multisite timeshare plan in a given calendar year pursuant to paragraph (e) if the amount of such substituted accommodations provides more than 10 percent of the total annual use availability in the multisite timeshare plan calculated in 7-day increments.

3.âIf the timeshare instrument provides that the managing entity is the person authorized to make substitutions, and the managing entity is not under common ownership or control with the developer, the managing entity may not substitute available accommodations in the multisite timeshare plan in a given calendar year pursuant to paragraph (e) if the amount of such substituted accommodations provides more than 25 percent of the total annual use availability in the multisite timeshare plan calculated in 7-day increments.

4.âIf the person authorized to make substitutions receives, within 21 days after the date of the notice of substitution required by paragraph (e), a written objection to the proposed substitution from at least 10 percent of all purchasers in the multisite timeshare plan, a meeting of the purchasers must be conducted by the managing entity within 30 days after the end of such 21-day period. The proposed substitution is ratified unless it is rejected by a majority of purchasers voting in person or by proxy at the meeting, provided that at least 25 percent of all purchasers cast votes. This subparagraph does not apply if the timeshare instrument provides that purchasers do not have the right to consent to any proposed substitutions.

5.âThis paragraph does not apply if the proposed substitution is approved in advance pursuant to paragraph (f).

(e)âThe person authorized to make substitutions shall notify all purchasers of the multisite timeshare plan in writing of her or his intention to delete accommodations or facilities and to substitute them with other specified accommodations or facilities pursuant to this subsection. This notice must be given at least 6 months in advance of the date that the proposed substitution will occur; must state the last day after the end of the 6-month period on which reservations will be accepted from purchasers for use of the accommodations to be deleted; and must state that purchasers shall have 21 days after the date of the notice of substitution to file a written objection with the person authorized to make substitutions. The person authorized to make substitutions may delete accommodations for substitution only after such accommodations have no pending purchaser use reservations.

(f)âThe person authorized to make substitutions may make unlimited substitutions in a given year without compliance with paragraphs (d) and (e) if a proposed substitution is approved in advance by a majority of purchasers of the multisite timeshare plan voting in person or by proxy at a meeting called for that purpose, provided that at least 25 percent of the total number of purchasers cast votes. Substitutions made pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b)2.

(g)âIf the person authorized to make substitutions has fully complied with the applicable provisions of this subsection and the timeshare instrument, the trustee of a timeshare trust qualified under s. [721.53](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.53)(1)(e) may convey title to any accommodations and facilities that have been designated or approved for substitution as and when directed by the person authorized to make substitutions without any further vote or other authorization of the purchasers of the multisite timeshare plan.

(h)âThe person who is authorized by the timeshare instrument to make substitutions to the multisite timeshare plan pursuant to this subsection shall act as a fiduciary in such capacity in the best interests of the purchasers of the plan as a whole and shall adhere to the demand balancing standard set forth in s. [721.56](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.56)(6) in connection with such substitutions. Substitutions that are otherwise permitted may be made only so long as a one-to-one use right to use night requirement ratio is maintained at all times.

(3)âDELETIONS.â

(a)âDeletion by casualty.â

1.âPursuant to s. [721.165](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.165), the timeshare instrument creating the multisite timeshare plan must provide for casualty insurance for the accommodations and facilities of the multisite timeshare plan in an amount equal to the replacement cost of such accommodations or facilities. The timeshare instrument must also provide that in the event of a casualty that results in accommodations or facilities being unavailable for use by purchasers, the managing entity shall notify all affected purchasers of such unavailability of use within 30 days after the event of casualty.

2.âThe timeshare instrument must also provide for the application of any insurance proceeds arising from a casualty to either the replacement or acquisition of additional similar accommodations or facilities or to the removal of purchasers from the multisite timeshare plan so that purchasers will not be competing for available accommodations on a greater than one-to-one use right to use night requirement ratio.

3.âIf the timeshare instrument does not provide for business interruption insurance, or if it is unavailable, or if the instrument permits the developer, the managing entity, or the purchasers to elect not to reconstruct after casualty under certain circumstances or to secure replacement accommodations or facilities in lieu of reconstruction, purchasers of the plan may temporarily compete for available accommodations on a greater than one-to-one use right to use night requirement ratio. The decision whether or not to reconstruct shall be made as promptly as possible under the circumstances.

4.âAny replacement of accommodations or facilities pursuant to this paragraph shall be made upon the same basis as required for substitution as set forth in subparagraph (2)(b)2.

(b)âDeletion by eminent domain.â

1.âThe timeshare instrument creating the multisite timeshare plan must also provide for the application of any proceeds arising from a taking under eminent domain proceedings to either the replacement or acquisition of additional similar accommodations or facilities or to the removal of purchasers from the multisite timeshare plan so that purchasers will not be competing for available accommodations on a greater than one-to-one use right to use night requirement ratio.

2.âAny replacement of accommodations or facilities pursuant to this paragraph shall be made upon the same basis as required for substitution set forth in subparagraph (2)(b)2.

(c)âAutomatic deletion.âThe timeshare instrument may provide that a component site will be automatically deleted upon the expiration of its term or as otherwise provided in the timeshare instrument. However, the timeshare instrument must also provide that in the event a component site is deleted from the plan in this manner, a sufficient number of purchasers of the plan will also be deleted, or a sufficient number of replacement accommodations and facilities that comply with subparagraph (2)(b)2. will be substituted for the deleted accommodations and facilities, so as to maintain no greater than a one-to-one use right to use night requirement ratio.

(4)âVIOLATIONS; PURCHASER REMEDIES.âAll purchaser remedies pursuant to s. [721.21](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.21) shall be available for any violation of the provisions of this section.

(1)âThe developer as a prerequisite for approval of his or her public offering statement filing or his or her phase filing must obtain an affidavit, or other evidence satisfactory to the director of the division, from the component site managing entity containing all of the following:

(a)âA statement that all assessments on inventory are fully paid as required by applicable law.

(b)âA statement as to the amount of delinquent assessments existing at the component site, if any.

(c)âIf required by applicable law, a statement that the latest annual audit of the component site shows that, if required, reserves are adequately maintained with respect to each component site.

(d)âA statement that the component site managing entity specifically acknowledges the existence of the multisite timeshare plan relating to the use of the accommodations and facilities of the component site by purchasers of the plan.

(2)âIn the event that the developer files an affidavit or other evidence with the division pursuant to subsection (1) and subsequently determines that the status of the component site has materially changed such that any portion of the affidavit or other evidence is consequently materially changed, the developer shall immediately notify the division of the change.

(3)(a)âThe managing entity of the multisite timeshare plan shall establish an escrow account with an escrow agent qualified pursuant to s. [721.05](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.05) and deposit into such account all payments received by the managing entity from time to time from the developer and purchasers of the plan that relate to common expenses and real estate taxes due with respect to any component site. The managing entity of the multisite timeshare plan shall not be required to escrow payments received from the developer or purchasers that relate to other plan expenses, including those pertaining to the compensation of the managing entity of the multisite timeshare plan and pertaining to the operation of the reservation system.

(b)âFunds may only be disbursed from the escrow account described in paragraph (a) by the escrow agent upon receipt of an affidavit from the managing entity of the multisite timeshare plan specifying the purpose for which the disbursement is requested and making reference to the budgetary source of authority for such disbursement. The escrow agent shall only disburse moneys from escrow relating to a particular component site directly to the managing entity of that component site. Real estate tax payments shall only be disbursed from the escrow account to the component site managing entity or to the appropriate tax collection authority pursuant to applicable law.

(c)âThe escrow agent shall be entitled to rely upon the affidavit of the managing entity and shall have no obligation to independently ascertain the propriety of the requested disbursement so long as the escrow agent has no actual knowledge that the affidavit is false in any respect.

(d)âAn escrow agent shall maintain the account called for in this section only in such a manner as to be under the direct supervision and control of the escrow agent. The escrow agent shall have a fiduciary duty to each purchaser to maintain the escrow account in accordance with good accounting principles and to release funds from escrow only in accordance with this subsection. The escrow agent shall retain all affidavits received pursuant to this subsection for a period of 5 years. Should the escrow agent receive conflicting demands for the escrowed funds, the escrow agent shall immediately notify the division of the dispute and either promptly submit the matter to arbitration or, by interpleader or otherwise, seek an adjudication of the matter by court.

(e)âAny managing entity or escrow agent who intentionally fails to comply with the provisions of this subsection concerning the establishment of an escrow account, deposit of funds into escrow, and withdrawal therefrom commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. [775.082](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.082), s. [775.083](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.083), or s. [775.084](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.084), or the successor thereof. The failure to establish an escrow account or to place funds therein as required in this subsection is prima facie evidence of an intentional and purposeful violation of this subsection.

(f)âIn lieu of the escrow required by this subsection, the director of the division shall have the discretion to accept other assurances in accordance with s. [721.08](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.08), provided that such other assurances are maintained at a minimum amount equal to the total common expense assessment payments for the then-current fiscal year.

(4)âThe managing entity of a multisite timeshare plan shall comply fully with the requirements of s. [721.13](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.13), subject to the provisions of s. [721.13](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.13)(11) for personal property timeshare plans; however, with respect to a given component site, the managing entity of the multisite timeshare plan shall not be responsible for compliance as the managing entity of that component site unless the managing entity of the multisite timeshare plan is also the managing entity of that component site. Unless the timeshare instrument provides otherwise, the operator of the reservation system is the managing entity of a multisite timeshare plan.

(5)âNothing contained in this part shall preclude a manager or management firm that is serving as managing entity of a multisite timeshare plan from providing in its contract with the purchasers or ownersâ association of the multisite timeshare plan or in the timeshare instrument that the manager or management firm owns the reservation system and that the managing entity shall continue to own the reservation system in the event the purchasers discharge the managing entity pursuant to s. [721.14](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.14).

(6)âPrior to offering the multisite timeshare plan, the developer shall create the reservation system and shall establish rules and regulations for its operation. In establishing these rules and regulations, the developer shall take into account the location and anticipated relative use demand of each component site that he or she intends to offer as a part of the plan and shall use his or her best efforts, in good faith and based upon all reasonably available evidence under the circumstances, to further the best interests of the purchasers of the plan as a whole with respect to their opportunity to use and enjoy the accommodations and facilities of the plan. The rules and regulations shall also provide for periodic adjustment or amendment of the reservation system by the managing entity from time to time in order to respond to actual purchaser use patterns and changes in purchaser use demand for the accommodations and facilities existing at that time within the plan. The person authorized to make additions and substitutions during the term of the multisite timeshare plan shall also comply with the requirements of this subsection in ascertaining the desirability of the proposed addition, substitution, adjustment, or amendment and the impact of same upon the demand for and availability of existing plan accommodations and facilities.

721.855âProcedure for the trustee foreclosure of assessment liens.âThe provisions of this section establish a trustee foreclosure procedure for assessment liens.

(1)âAPPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE.â

(a)âA trustee or a substitute trustee may be appointed by a lienholder at any time by recording a notice of appointment of trustee or notice of substitution of trustee in the official records of the county or counties in which the timeshare interest is located. A lienholder may appoint multiple trustees in a single appointment, and any appointed trustee may be used by the lienholder regarding the trustee foreclosure of any assessment lien under any timeshare plan for which the trustee is appointed.

(b)âA trustee shall use good faith, skill, care, and diligence in discharging all of the trustee duties under this section and shall deal honestly and fairly with all parties.

(c)âThe recorded notice of appointment of trustee or notice of substitution of trustee shall contain the name and address of the trustee or substitute trustee, the name and address of the lienholder, and the name and address of the timeshare plan.

(2)âINITIATING THE USE OF A TRUSTEE FORECLOSURE PROCEDURE.â

(a)âBefore initiating the trustee foreclosure procedure against any timeshare interest in a given timeshare plan:

1.âIf a timeshare instrument contains any provision specifically prohibiting the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure, or if the managing entity otherwise determines that the timeshare instrument should be amended to specifically provide for the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure, an amendment to the timeshare instrument permitting the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure set forth in this section must be adopted and recorded prior to the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure. Such amendment to the timeshare instrument shall contain a statement in substantially the following form and may be adopted by a majority of those present and voting at a duly called meeting of the ownersâ association at which at least 15 percent of the voting interests are present in person or by proxy:

If a timeshare owner fails to make timely payments of timeshare plan common expenses, ad valorem taxes, or special assessments, an assessment lien against the timeshare ownerâs timeshare interest may be foreclosed in accordance with a judicial foreclosure procedure or a trustee foreclosure procedure, either of which may result in the loss of the timeshare ownerâs timeshare interest. If the managing entity initiates a trustee foreclosure procedure, the timeshare owner shall have the option to object pursuant to Florida law, and in such event the managing entity may thereafter proceed only by filing a judicial foreclosure action.

2.âThe managing entity shall inform owners of timeshare interests in the timeshare plan in writing that the managing entity has the right to elect to use the trustee foreclosure procedure with respect to foreclosure of assessment liens as established in this section. The managing entity shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this subparagraph if the owners of timeshare interests in the given timeshare plan are informed by mail sent to each ownerâs notice address, in the notice of an annual or special meeting of the owners, by posting on the website of the applicable timeshare plan, or by any owner communication used by the managing entity.

(b)âBefore initiating the trustee foreclosure procedure against any timeshare interest, a claim of lien against the timeshare interest shall be recorded under s. [721.16](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.16) or, if applicable, s. [718.116](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.116) or s. [719.108](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.108), and the notice of the intent to file a lien shall be given under s. [718.121](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/718.121) for timeshare condominiums and s. [719.108](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/719.108) for timeshare cooperatives.

(c)1.âIn order to initiate a trustee foreclosure procedure against a timeshare interest, the lienholder shall deliver an affidavit to the trustee that identifies the obligor; the notice address of the obligor; the timeshare interest; the date that the notice of the intent to file a lien was given, if applicable; the official records book and page number where the claim of lien is recorded; and the name and notice address of any junior interestholder.

2.âThe affidavit shall also state the facts that establish that the obligor has defaulted in the obligation to make a payment under a specified provision of the timeshare instrument or applicable law.

3.âThe affidavit shall also specify the amounts secured by the lien as of the date of the affidavit and a per diem amount to account for further accrual of the amounts secured by the lien.

4.âThe affidavit shall also state that the assessment lien was properly created and authorized pursuant to the timeshare instrument and applicable law.

(3)âOBLIGORâS RIGHTS.â

(a)âThe obligor may object to the lienholderâs use of the trustee foreclosure procedure for a specific default any time before the sale of the timeshare interest under subsection (7) by delivering a written objection to the trustee using the objection form provided for in subsection (5). If the trustee receives the written objection from the obligor, the trustee may not proceed with the trustee foreclosure procedure as to the default specified in the notice of default and intent to foreclose under subsection (5), and the lienholder may proceed thereafter only with a judicial foreclosure action as to that specified default.

(b)âAt any time before the trustee issues the certificate of sale under paragraph (7)(f), the obligor may cure the default and redeem the timeshare interest by paying the amounts secured by the lien in cash or certified funds to the trustee. After the trustee issues the certificate of sale, there is no right of redemption.

(4)âCONDITIONS TO TRUSTEEâS EXERCISE OF POWER OF SALE.âA trustee may sell an encumbered timeshare interest foreclosed under this section if:

(a)âThe trustee has received the affidavit from the lienholder under paragraph (2)(c);

(b)âThe trustee has not received a written objection to the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure under paragraph (3)(a) and the timeshare interest was not redeemed under paragraph (3)(b);

(c)âThere is no lis pendens recorded and pending against the same timeshare interest before the recording of the notice of lis pendens pursuant to paragraph (5)(h), and the trustee has not been served notice of the filing of any action to enjoin the trustee foreclosure sale;

(d)âThe trustee has provided written notice of default and intent to foreclose as required under subsection (5) and a period of at least 30 calendar days has elapsed after such notice is deemed perfected under subsection (5);

(e)âThe notice of sale required under subsection (6) has been recorded in the official records of the county or counties in which the timeshare interest is located; and

(f)âThe lienholder has provided the trustee with a title search of the timeshare interest identifying any junior interestholders of record, the effective date of which search must be within 60 calendar days before the date it is delivered to the trustee. If a title search reveals that incorrect obligors or junior interestholders have been served or additional obligors or junior interestholders have not been served, the foreclosure action may not proceed until the notices required pursuant to this section have been served on the correct or additional obligors or junior interestholders and all applicable time periods have expired.

(5)âNOTICE OF DEFAULT AND INTENT TO FORECLOSE.â

(a)âIn any foreclosure proceeding under this section, the trustee is required to notify the obligor of the proceeding by sending the obligor a written notice of default and intent to foreclose to the notice address of the obligor by certified mail, registered mail, or permitted delivery service, return receipt requested, and by first-class mail, postage prepaid, as follows:

1.âThe notice of default and intent to foreclose shall identify the obligor, the notice address of the obligor, the legal description of the timeshare interest, the nature of the default, the amounts secured by the lien, and a per diem amount to account for further accrual of the amounts secured by the lien and shall state the method by which the obligor may cure the default, including the period of time after the date of the notice of default and intent to foreclose within which the obligor may cure the default.

2.âThe notice of default and intent to foreclose shall include an objection form with which the obligor can object to the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure by signing and returning the objection form to the trustee. The objection form shall identify the obligor, the notice address of the obligor, the timeshare interest, and the return address of the trustee and shall state: âThe undersigned obligor exercises the obligorâs right to object to the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure contained in section [721.855](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.855), Florida Statutes.â

3.âThe notice of default and intent to foreclose shall also contain a statement in substantially the following form:

If you fail to cure the default as set forth in this notice or take other appropriate action with regard to this foreclosure matter, you risk losing ownership of your timeshare interest through the trustee foreclosure procedure established in section [721.855](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.855), Florida Statutes. You may choose to sign and send to the trustee the enclosed objection form, exercising your right to object to the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure. Upon the trusteeâs receipt of your signed objection form, the foreclosure of the lien with respect to the default specified in this notice shall be subject to the judicial foreclosure procedure only. You have the right to cure your default in the manner set forth in this notice at any time before the trusteeâs sale of your timeshare interest. If you do not object to the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure, you will not be subject to a deficiency judgment even if the proceeds from the sale of your timeshare interest are insufficient to offset the amounts secured by the lien.

4.âThe trustee shall also mail a copy of the notice of default and intent to foreclose, without the objection form, to the notice address of any junior interestholder by certified mail, registered mail, or permitted delivery service, return receipt requested, and by first-class mail, postage prepaid.

5.âNotice under this paragraph is considered perfected upon the trustee receiving the return receipt bearing the signature of the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, within 30 calendar days after the trustee sent the notice under this paragraph. Notice under this paragraph is not perfected if:

a.âThe notice is returned as undeliverable within 30 calendar days after the trustee sent the notice;

b.âThe trustee cannot, in good faith, ascertain that the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, is the person who signed the receipt because all or a portion of the obligorâs or junior interestholderâs name is not on the signed receipt or because the trustee cannot otherwise determine that the obligor or junior interestholder signed the receipt; or

c.âThe receipt from the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, is returned or refused within 30 calendar days after the trustee sent the notice.

(b)âIf the notice required by paragraph (a) is returned as undeliverable within 30 calendar days after the trustee sent the notice, the trustee shall perform a diligent search and inquiry to obtain a different address for the obligor or junior interestholder. For purposes of this paragraph, any address known and used by the lienholder for sending regular mailings or other communications from the lienholder to the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, shall be included with other addresses produced from the diligent search and inquiry, if any.

1.âIf the trusteeâs diligent search and inquiry produces an address different from the notice address, the trustee shall mail a copy of the notice by certified mail, registered mail, or permitted delivery service, return receipt requested, and by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the new address. Notice under this subparagraph is considered perfected upon the trustee receiving the return receipt bearing the signature of the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, within 30 calendar days after the trustee sent the notice under this subparagraph. Notice under this subparagraph is not perfected if the receipt from the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, is refused, returned, or the trustee cannot, in good faith, ascertain that the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, is the person who signed the receipt because all or a portion of the obligorâs or junior interestholderâs name is not on the signed receipt or because the trustee cannot otherwise determine that the obligor or junior interestholder signed the receipt. If the trustee does not perfect notice under this subparagraph, the trustee shall perfect service in the manner set forth in paragraph (c).

2.âIf the trusteeâs diligent search and inquiry does not locate a different address for the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, the trustee may perfect notice against that person under paragraph (c).

(c)âIf the notice is not perfected under subparagraph (a)5., and such notice was not returned as undeliverable, or if the notice was not perfected under subparagraph (b)1., the trustee may perfect notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the timeshare interest is located. The notice shall appear at least once a week for 2 consecutive weeks. The notice of default and intent to foreclose perfected by publication shall identify the obligor, the notice address of the obligor, the legal description of the timeshare interest, the nature of the action in short and simple terms, the name and contact information of the trustee, and the period of time after the date of the notice of default and intent to foreclose within which the obligor may cure the default. The trustee may group an unlimited number of notices in the same publication, if all of the notices pertain to the same timeshare plan. Notice under this paragraph is considered perfected upon publication as required in this paragraph.

(d)âIf notice is perfected under subparagraph (a)5., the trustee shall execute an affidavit in recordable form setting forth the manner in which notice was perfected and attach the affidavit to the certificate of compliance set forth in subsection (9). The affidavit shall state the nature of the notice, the date on which the notice was mailed, the name and address on the envelope containing the notice, the manner in which the notice was mailed, and the basis for that knowledge.

(e)âIf notice is perfected under subparagraph (b)1., the trustee shall execute an affidavit in recordable form setting forth the manner in which notice was perfected and attach the affidavit to the certificate of compliance set forth in subsection (9). The affidavit shall state the nature of the notice, the dates on which the notice was mailed, the name and addresses on the envelopes containing the notice, the manner in which the notices were mailed, and the fact that a signed receipt from the certified mail, registered mail, or permitted delivery service was timely received.

(f)âIf notice is perfected by publication under paragraph (c), the trustee shall execute an affidavit in recordable form setting forth the manner in which notice was perfected and attach the affidavit to the certificate of compliance set forth in subsection (9). The affidavit shall include all the information contained in either paragraph (d) or paragraph (e), as applicable, shall state that the notice was perfected by publication, and shall state that diligent search and inquiry was made for the current address for the person, if paragraph (b) applies. The affidavit shall also include the information required, as applicable, by s. [49.041](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/49.041) in the case of a natural person or s. [49.051](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/49.051) in the case of a corporation. No other action of the trustee is necessary to perfect notice.

(g)âNotice under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) is perfected as to all obligors who have the same address if notice is perfected as to at least one obligor at that address pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.

(h)âThe initiation of a trustee foreclosure action operates as a lis pendens on the timeshare interest pursuant to s. [48.23](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/48.23) if a notice of lis pendens is recorded in the official records of the county in which the deed conveying the timeshare interest to the obligor was recorded and such notice has not expired pursuant to s. [48.23](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/48.23)(2) or been withdrawn or discharged. The notice of lis pendens must contain the following:

1.âThe name of the obligor.

2.âThe date of the initiation of the trustee foreclosure action, which date shall be the date of the sending of the notice of default and intent to foreclose to the obligor.

8.âThe right of and the method by which the obligor may cure the default or the right of any junior interestholder to redeem its interest up to the date the trustee issues the certificate of sale in accordance with paragraph (7)(f).

(b)âThe trustee shall send a copy of the notice of sale within 3 business days after the date it is submitted for recording, by first-class mail or permitted delivery service, postage prepaid, to the notice addresses of the obligor and any junior interestholder.

(c)âAfter the date of recording of the notice of sale, notice is not required to be given to any person claiming an interest in the timeshare interest except as provided in this section. If a notice of lis pendens has not previously been recorded pursuant to paragraph (5)(h), the recording of the notice of sale has the same force and effect as the filing of a lis pendens in a judicial proceeding under s. [48.23](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/48.23).

(d)1.âThe trustee shall publish the notice of sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the timeshare interest is located at least once a week for 2 consecutive weeks before the date of the sale. The last publication shall occur at least 5 calendar days before the sale.

2.âThe trustee may group an unlimited number of notices of sale in the same publication, if all of the notices of sale pertain to the same timeshare plan.

(7)âMANNER OF SALE.â

(a)âThe sale of a timeshare interest by the trustee in a public auction shall be held in the county in which the timeshare interest is located, on the date, location, and starting time designated in the notice of sale, which shall be after 9:00 a.m. but before 4:00 p.m. on a business day not less than 30 calendar days after the recording of the notice of sale. The trusteeâs sale may occur online at a specific website on the Internet or in any other manner used by the clerk of the court for a judicial foreclosure sales procedure in the county or counties in which the timeshare interest is located.

(b)âThe trustee shall conduct the sale and act as the auctioneer. The trustee may use a third party to conduct the sale on behalf of the trustee, and the trustee is liable for the conduct of the sale and the actions of the third party with respect to the conduct of the sale.

(c)âThe lienholder and any person other than the trustee may bid at the sale. In lieu of participating in the sale, the lienholder may send the trustee written bidding instructions that the trustee shall announce as appropriate during the sale.

(d)âThe trustee may postpone the sale from time to time. In such case, notice of postponement must be given by the trustee at the date, time, and location contained in the notice of sale. The notice of sale for the postponed sale shall be mailed under paragraph (6)(b), recorded under paragraph (4)(e), and published under paragraph (6)(d). The effective date of the initial notice of sale under paragraph (6)(b) is not affected by a postponed sale.

(e)âThe highest bidder of the timeshare interest shall pay the price bid to the trustee in cash or certified funds on the day of the sale. If the lienholder is the highest bidder, the lienholder shall receive a credit up to the amount set forth in the notice of sale as required under subparagraph (6)(a)6.

(f)âOn the date of the sale and upon receipt of the cash or certified funds due from the highest bidder, the trustee shall issue to the highest bidder a certificate of sale stating that a foreclosure conforming to the requirements of this section has occurred, including the time, location, and date of the sale, that the timeshare interest was sold, the amounts secured by the lien, and the amount of the highest bid. A copy of the certificate of sale shall be mailed by certified mail, registered mail, or permitted delivery service, return receipt requested, to all persons entitled to receive a notice of sale under subsection (6).

(g)âBefore a sale conducted under this subsection, a junior interestholder may pursue adjudication by court, by interpleader, or in any other authorized manner respecting any matter that is disputed by the junior interestholder.

(8)âEFFECT OF TRUSTEEâS SALE.â

(a)âA sale conducted under subsection (7) forecloses and terminates all interests of any person with notice to whom notice is given under paragraph (4)(d) and paragraph (6)(b), and of any other person claiming interests by, through, or under any such person, in the affected timeshare interest. A failure to give notice to any person entitled to notice does not affect the validity of the sale as to the interests of any person properly notified. A person entitled to notice but not given notice has the rights of a person not made a defendant in a judicial foreclosure.

(b)âOn the issuance of a certificate of sale under paragraph (7)(f), all rights of redemption that have been foreclosed under this section shall terminate.

(c)âA sale conducted under subsection (7) releases the obligorâs liability for all amounts secured by the lien. The lienholder has no right to any deficiency judgment against the obligor after a sale of the obligorâs timeshare interest under this section.

(d)âThe issuance and recording of the trusteeâs deed is presumed valid and may be relied upon by third parties without actual knowledge of irregularities in the foreclosure proceedings. If for any reason there is an irregularity in the foreclosure proceedings, a purchaser becomes subrogated to all the rights of the lienholder to the indebtedness that it secured to the extent necessary to reforeclose the assessment lien in order to correct the irregularity and becomes entitled to an action de novo for the foreclosure of such assessment lien. Any subsequent reforeclosure required to correct an irregularity may be conducted under this section.

(9)âTRUSTEEâS CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.â

(a)âWithin 10 calendar days after the trustee conducts a sale, the trustee shall execute and acknowledge a certificate of compliance that:

1.âConfirms delivery of the notice of default and intent to foreclose and attaches the affidavit required under subsection (5).

2.âStates that the default was not cured, that the trustee did not receive any written objection under paragraph (3)(a), and that the timeshare interest was not redeemed under paragraph (3)(b).

3.âConfirms that the notice of sale was published as required under paragraph (6)(d) and attaches an affidavit of publication for the notice of sale.

4.âConfirms that the notice of sale was mailed under paragraph (6)(b), together with a list of the parties to whom the notice of sale was mailed.

The trusteeâs deed shall contain no warranties of title from the trustee. The certificate of compliance shall be attached as an exhibit to the trusteeâs deed.

(b)âTen calendar days after a sale, absent the prior filing and service on the trustee of a judicial action to enjoin issuance of the trusteeâs deed to the timeshare interest, the trustee shall:

1.âIssue a trusteeâs deed to the highest bidder.

2.âRecord the trusteeâs deed in the official records of the county or counties in which the timeshare interest is located.

(c)1.âThe certificate of compliance and trusteeâs deed together are presumptive evidence of the truth of the matters set forth in them, and an action to set aside the sale and void the trusteeâs deed may not be filed or otherwise pursued against any person acquiring the timeshare interest for value.

2.âThe trusteeâs deed conveys to the highest bidder all rights, title, and interest in the timeshare interest that the former owner had, or had the power to convey, at the time of the recording of the claim of lien, together with all rights, title, and interest that the former owner or his or her successors in interest acquired after the recording of the claim of lien.

721.856âProcedure for the trustee foreclosure of mortgage liens.âThe provisions of this section establish a trustee foreclosure procedure for mortgage liens.

(1)âAPPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE.â

(a)âA trustee or a substitute trustee may be appointed by a lienholder at any time by recording a notice of appointment of trustee or notice of substitution of trustee in the official records of the county or counties in which the timeshare interest is located. A lienholder may appoint multiple trustees in a single appointment, and any appointed trustee may be used by the lienholder regarding the trustee foreclosure of any mortgage lien.

(b)âA trustee shall use good faith, skill, care, and diligence in discharging all of the trustee duties under this section and shall deal honestly and fairly with all parties.

(c)âThe recorded notice of appointment of trustee or notice of substitution of trustee shall contain the name and address of the trustee or substitute trustee, the name and address of the lienholder, and the name and address of the timeshare plan.

(2)âINITIATING THE TRUSTEE FORECLOSURE OF MORTGAGE LIENS.â

(a)âBefore initiating the trustee foreclosure against a timeshare interest, the mortgage, or an amendment to a mortgage executed by the obligor before the effective date of this section, must contain a statement in substantially the following form:

If the mortgagor fails to make timely payments under the obligation secured by this mortgage, or is otherwise deemed in uncured default of this mortgage, the lien against the mortgagorâs timeshare interest created by this mortgage may be foreclosed in accordance with either a judicial foreclosure procedure or a trustee foreclosure procedure and may result in the loss of your timeshare interest. If the mortgagee initiates a trustee foreclosure procedure, the mortgagor shall have the option to object and the mortgagee may proceed only by filing a judicial foreclosure action.

(b)1.âIn order to initiate a trustee foreclosure procedure against a timeshare interest, the lienholder shall deliver an affidavit to the trustee that identifies the obligor, the notice address of the obligor, the timeshare interest, the official records book and page number where the mortgage is recorded, and the name and notice address of any junior interestholder.

2.âThe affidavit shall also state the facts that establish that the obligor has defaulted in the obligation to make a payment under a specified provision of the mortgage or is otherwise deemed in uncured default under a specified provision of the mortgage.

3.âThe affidavit shall also specify the amounts secured by the lien as of the date of the affidavit and a per diem amount to account for further accrual of the amounts secured by the lien.

4.âThe affidavit shall also state that the appropriate amount of documentary stamp tax and intangible taxes has been paid upon recording of the mortgage, or otherwise paid to the state.

5.âThe affidavit shall also state that the lienholder is the holder of the note and has complied with all preconditions in the note and mortgage to determine the amounts secured by the lien and to initiate the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure.

(3)âOBLIGORâS RIGHTS.â

(a)âThe obligor may object to the lienholderâs use of the trustee foreclosure procedure for a specific default any time before the sale of the timeshare interest under subsection (7) by delivering a written objection to the trustee using the objection form provided for in subsection (5). If the trustee receives the written objection from the obligor, the trustee may not proceed with the trustee foreclosure procedure as to the default specified in the notice of default and intent to foreclose under subsection (5), and the lienholder may proceed thereafter only with a judicial foreclosure action as to that specified default.

(b)âAt any time before the trustee issues the certificate of sale under paragraph (7)(f), the obligor may cure the default and redeem the timeshare interest by paying the amounts secured by the lien in cash or certified funds to the trustee. After the trustee issues the certificate of sale, there is no right of redemption.

(4)âCONDITIONS TO TRUSTEEâS EXERCISE OF POWER OF SALE.âA trustee may sell an encumbered timeshare interest foreclosed under this section if:

(a)âThe trustee has received the affidavit from the lienholder under paragraph (2)(b);

(b)âThe trustee has not received a written objection to the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure under paragraph (3)(a) and the timeshare interest was not redeemed under paragraph (3)(b);

(c)âThere is no lis pendens recorded and pending against the same timeshare interest before the initiation of the trustee foreclosure action and provided a notice of lis pendens has been recorded pursuant to paragraph (5)(h), and the trustee has not been served notice of the filing of any action to enjoin the trustee foreclosure sale;

(d)âThe trustee is in possession of the original promissory note executed by the mortgagor and secured by the mortgage lien;

(e)âThe trustee has provided written notice of default and intent to foreclose as required under subsection (5) and a period of at least 30 calendar days has elapsed after such notice is deemed perfected under subsection (5);

(f)âThe notice of sale required under subsection (6) has been recorded in the official records of the county in which the mortgage was recorded; and

(g)âThe lienholder has provided the trustee with a title search of the timeshare interest identifying any junior interestholders of record, the effective date of which search must be within 60 calendar days before the date it is delivered to the trustee. If a title search reveals that incorrect obligors or junior interestholders have been served or additional obligors or junior interestholders have not been served, the foreclosure action may not proceed until the notices required pursuant to this section have been served on the correct or additional obligors or junior interestholders and all applicable time periods have expired.

(5)âNOTICE OF DEFAULT AND INTENT TO FORECLOSE.â

(a)âIn any foreclosure proceeding under this section, the trustee is required to notify the obligor of the proceeding by sending the obligor a written notice of default and intent to foreclose to the notice address of the obligor by certified mail, registered mail, or permitted delivery service, return receipt requested, and by first-class mail, postage prepaid, as follows:

1.âThe notice of default and intent to foreclose shall identify the obligor, the notice address of the obligor, the legal description of the timeshare interest, the nature of the default, the amounts secured by the lien, and a per diem amount to account for further accrual of the amounts secured by the lien and shall state the method by which the obligor may cure the default, including the period of time after the date of the notice of default and intent to foreclose within which the obligor may cure the default.

2.âThe notice of default and intent to foreclose shall include an objection form with which the obligor can object to the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure by signing and returning the objection form to the trustee. The objection form shall identify the obligor, the notice address of the obligor, the timeshare interest, and the return address of the trustee and shall state: âThe undersigned obligor exercises the obligorâs right to object to the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure contained in section [721.856](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.856), Florida Statutes.â

3.âThe notice of default and intent to foreclose shall also contain a statement in substantially the following form:

If you fail to cure the default as set forth in this notice or take other appropriate action with regard to this foreclosure matter, you risk losing ownership of your timeshare interest through the trustee foreclosure procedure established in section [721.856](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/721.856), Florida Statutes. You may choose to sign and send to the trustee the enclosed objection form, exercising your right to object to the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure. Upon the trusteeâs receipt of your signed objection form, the foreclosure of the lien with respect to the default specified in this notice shall be subject to the judicial foreclosure procedure only. You have the right to cure your default in the manner set forth in this notice at any time before the trusteeâs sale of your timeshare interest. If you do not object to the use of the trustee foreclosure procedure, you will not be subject to a deficiency judgment even if the proceeds from the sale of your timeshare interest are insufficient to offset the amounts secured by the lien.

4.âThe trustee shall also mail a copy of the notice of default and intent to foreclose, without the objection form, to the notice address of any junior interestholder by certified mail, registered mail, or permitted delivery service, return receipt requested, and by first-class mail, postage prepaid.

5.âNotice under this paragraph is considered perfected upon the trustee receiving the return receipt bearing the signature of the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, within 30 calendar days after the trustee sent the notice under this paragraph. Notice under this paragraph is not perfected if:

a.âThe notice is returned as undeliverable within 30 calendar days after the trustee sent the notice;

b.âThe trustee cannot, in good faith, ascertain from the receipt that the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, is the person who signed the receipt because all or a portion of the obligorâs or junior interestholderâs name is not on the signed receipt or the trustee cannot otherwise determine that the obligor or junior interestholder signed the receipt; or

c.âThe receipt from the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, is returned or refused within 30 calendar days after the trustee sent the notice.

(b)âIf the notice required by paragraph (a) is returned as undeliverable within 30 calendar days after the trustee sent the notice, the trustee shall perform a diligent search and inquiry to obtain a different address for the obligor or junior interestholder. For purposes of this paragraph, any address known and used by the lienholder for sending regular mailings or other communications from the lienholder to the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, shall be included with other addresses produced from the diligent search and inquiry, if any.

1.âIf the trusteeâs diligent search and inquiry produces an address different from the notice address, the trustee shall mail a copy of the notice by certified mail, registered mail, or permitted delivery service, return receipt requested, and by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the new address. Notice under this subparagraph is considered perfected upon the trustee receiving the return receipt bearing the signature of the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, within 30 calendar days after the trustee sent the notice under this subparagraph. Notice under this subparagraph is not perfected if the receipt from the obligor or junior interestholder is refused, returned, or the trustee cannot, in good faith, ascertain that the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, is the person who signed the receipt because all or a portion of the obligorâs or junior interestholderâs name is not on the signed receipt or because the trustee cannot otherwise determine that the obligor or junior interestholder signed the receipt. If the trustee does not perfect notice under this subparagraph, the trustee shall perfect service in the manner set forth in paragraph (c).

2.âIf the trusteeâs diligent search and inquiry does not locate a different address for the obligor or junior interestholder, as applicable, the trustee may perfect notice against that person under paragraph (c).

(c)âIf the notice is not perfected under subparagraph (a)5., and such notice was not returned as undeliverable, or if the notice was not perfected under subparagraph (b)1., the trustee may perfect notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the timeshare interest is located. The notice shall appear at least once a week for 2 consecutive weeks. The notice of default and intent to foreclose perfected by publication shall identify the obligor, the notice address of the obligor, the legal description of the timeshare interest, the nature of the action in short and simple terms, the name and contact information of the trustee, and the period of time after the date of the notice of default and intent to foreclose within which the obligor may cure the default. The trustee may group an unlimited number of notices in the same publication, if all of the notices pertain to the same timeshare plan. Notice under this paragraph is considered perfected upon publication as required in this paragraph.

(d)âIf notice is perfected under subparagraph (a)5., the trustee shall execute an affidavit in recordable form setting forth the manner in which notice was perfected and attach the affidavit to the certificate of compliance set forth in subsection (9). The affidavit shall state the nature of the notice, the date on which the notice was mailed, the name and address on the envelope containing the notice, the manner in which the notice was mailed, and the basis for that knowledge.

(e)âIf notice is perfected under subparagraph (b)1., the trustee shall execute an affidavit in recordable form setting forth the manner in which notice was perfected and attach the affidavit to the certificate of compliance set forth in subsection (9). The affidavit shall state the nature of the notice, the dates on which the notice was mailed, the name and addresses on the envelopes containing the notice, the manner in which the notice was mailed, and the fact that a signed receipt from the certified mail, registered mail, or permitted delivery service was timely received.

(f)âIf notice is perfected under paragraph (c), the trustee shall execute an affidavit in recordable form setting forth the manner in which notice was perfected and attach the affidavit to the certificate of compliance set forth in subsection (9). The affidavit shall include all the information contained in either paragraph (d) or paragraph (e), as applicable, shall state that the notice was perfected by publication and shall state that diligent search and inquiry was made for the current address for the person, if paragraph (b) applies. The affidavit shall also include the information required, as applicable, by s. [49.041](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/49.041) in the case of a natural person or s. [49.051](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/49.051) in the case of a corporation. No other action of the trustee is necessary to perfect notice.

(g)âNotice under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) is perfected as to all obligors who have the same address if notice is perfected as to at least one obligor at that address pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.

(h)âThe initiation of a trustee foreclosure action operates as a lis pendens on the timeshare interest pursuant to s. [48.23](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/48.23) if a notice of lis pendens is recorded in the official records of the county or counties in which the mortgage is recorded and such notice has not expired pursuant to s. [48.23](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/48.23)(2) or been withdrawn or discharged. The notice of lis pendens must contain the following:

1.âThe name of the obligor.

2.âThe date of the initiation of the trustee foreclosure action, which date shall be the date of the sending of the notice of default and intent to foreclose to the obligor.

3.âThe name and contact information of the trustee.

4.âThe legal description of the timeshare interest.

5.âA statement that a trustee foreclosure action has been initiated against the timeshare interest pursuant to this section.

4.âA description of the default that is the basis for the foreclosure.

5.âThe official records book and page numbers where the mortgage is recorded.

6.âThe amounts secured by the lien and a per diem amount to account for further accrual of the amounts secured by the lien.

7.âThe date, location, and starting time of the trusteeâs sale.

8.âThe right of and the method by which the obligor may cure the default or the right of any junior interestholder to redeem its interest up to the date the trustee issues the certificate of sale in accordance with paragraph (7)(f).

(b)âThe trustee shall send a copy of the notice of sale within 3 business days after the date it is submitted for recording, by first-class mail or permitted delivery service, postage prepaid, to the notice addresses of the obligor and any junior interestholder.

(c)âAfter the date of recording of the notice of sale, notice is not required to be given to any person claiming an interest in the timeshare interest except as provided in this section. If a notice of lis pendens has not previously been recorded pursuant to paragraph (5)(h), the recording of the notice of sale has the same force and effect as the filing of a lis pendens in a judicial proceeding under s. [48.23](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/48.23).

(d)1.âThe trustee shall publish the notice of sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the timeshare interest is located at least once a week for 2 consecutive weeks before the date of the sale. The last publication shall occur at least 5 calendar days before the sale.

2.âThe trustee may group an unlimited number of notices of sale in the same publication, if all of the notices of sale pertain to the same timeshare plan.

(7)âMANNER OF SALE.â

(a)âThe sale of a timeshare interest by the trustee in a public auction shall be held in the county in which the timeshare interest is located, on the date, location, and starting time designated in the notice of sale, which shall be after 9:00 a.m. but before 4:00 p.m. on a business day not less than 30 calendar days after the recording of the notice of sale. The trusteeâs sale may occur online at a specific website on the Internet or in any other manner used by the clerk of the court for a judicial foreclosure sales procedure in the county or counties in which the timeshare interest is located.

(b)âThe trustee shall conduct the sale and act as the auctioneer. The trustee may use a third party to conduct the sale on behalf of the trustee, and the trustee is liable for the conduct of the sale and the actions of the third party with respect to the conduct of the sale.

(c)âThe lienholder and any person other than the trustee may bid at the sale. In lieu of participating in the sale, the lienholder may send the trustee written bidding instructions that the trustee shall announce as appropriate during the sale.

(d)âThe trustee may postpone the sale from time to time. In such case, notice of postponement must be given by the trustee at the date, time, and location contained in the notice of sale. The notice of sale for the postponed sale shall be mailed under paragraph (6)(b), recorded under paragraph (4)(f), and published under paragraph (6)(d). The effective date of the initial notice of sale under paragraph (6)(b) is not affected by a postponed sale.

(e)âThe highest bidder of the timeshare interest shall pay the price bid to the trustee in cash or certified funds on the day of the sale. If the lienholder is the highest bidder, the lienholder shall receive a credit up to the amount set forth in the notice of sale as required under subparagraph (6)(a)6.

(f)âOn the date of the sale and upon receipt of the cash or certified funds due from the highest bidder, the trustee shall issue to the highest bidder a certificate of sale stating that a foreclosure conforming to the requirements of this section has occurred, including the time, location, and date of the sale, that the timeshare interest was sold, the amounts secured by the lien, and the amount of the highest bid. A copy of the certificate of sale shall be mailed by certified mail, registered mail, or permitted delivery service, return receipt requested, to all persons entitled to receive a notice of sale under subsection (6).

(g)âBefore a sale conducted pursuant to this subsection, a junior interestholder may pursue adjudication by court, by interpleader, or in any other authorized manner respecting any matter that is disputed by the junior interestholder.

(8)âEFFECT OF TRUSTEEâS SALE.â

(a)âA sale conducted under subsection (7) forecloses and terminates all interests of any person with notice to whom notice is given under paragraph (4)(e) and paragraph (6)(b), and of any other person claiming interests by, through, or under any such person, in the affected timeshare interest. A failure to give notice to any person entitled to notice does not affect the validity of the sale as to the interests of any person properly notified. A person entitled to notice but not given notice has the rights of a person not made a defendant in a judicial foreclosure.

(b)âOn the issuance of a certificate of sale under paragraph (7)(f), all rights of redemption that have been foreclosed under this section shall terminate.

(c)âA sale conducted under subsection (7) releases the obligorâs liability for all amounts secured by the lien. The lienholder has no right to any deficiency judgment against the obligor after a sale of the obligorâs timeshare interest under this section.

(d)âThe issuance and recording of the trusteeâs deed is presumed valid and may be relied upon by third parties without actual knowledge of any irregularities in the foreclosure proceedings. If for any reason there is an irregularity in the foreclosure proceedings, a purchaser becomes subrogated to all the rights of the lienholder to the indebtedness that it secured to the extent necessary to reforeclose the mortgage lien in order to correct the irregularity and becomes entitled to an action de novo for the foreclosure of such mortgage lien. Any subsequent reforeclosure required to correct an irregularity may be conducted under this section.

(9)âTRUSTEEâS CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.â

(a)âWithin 10 calendar days after the trustee conducts a sale, the trustee shall execute and acknowledge a certificate of compliance which:

1.âConfirms delivery of the notice of default and intent to foreclose and attaches the affidavit required under subsection (5).

2.âStates that the default was not cured, that the trustee did not receive any written objection under paragraph (3)(a), and that the timeshare interest was not redeemed under paragraph (3)(b).

3.âStates that the trustee is in possession of the original promissory note executed by the mortgagor and secured by the mortgage lien.

4.âConfirms that the notice of sale was published as required under paragraph (6)(d) and attaches an affidavit of publication for the notice of sale.

5.âConfirms that the notice of sale was mailed under paragraph (6)(b), together with a list of the parties to whom the notice of sale was mailed.

(b)âIn furtherance of the execution of the certificate of compliance required under this subsection, the trustee is entitled to rely upon an affidavit or certification from the lienholder as to the facts and circumstances of default and failure to cure the default.

(10)âTRUSTEEâS DEED.â

(a)âThe trusteeâs deed shall include the name and address of the trustee, the name and address of the highest bidder, the name of the former owner, a legal description of the timeshare interest, and the name and address of the preparer of the trusteeâs deed. The trusteeâs deed shall contain no warranties of title from the trustee. The certificate of compliance shall be attached as an exhibit to the trusteeâs deed.

(b)âTen calendar days after a sale, absent the prior filing and service on the trustee of a judicial action to enjoin issuance of the trusteeâs deed to the timeshare interest, the trustee shall:

1.âCancel the original promissory note executed by the mortgagor and secured by the mortgage lien.

2.âIssue a trusteeâs deed to the highest bidder.

3.âRecord the trusteeâs deed in the official records of the county or counties in which the timeshare interest is located.

(c)1.âThe certificate of compliance and trusteeâs deed together are presumptive evidence of the truth of the matters set forth in them, and an action to set aside the sale and void the trusteeâs deed may not be filed or otherwise pursued against any person acquiring the timeshare interest for value.

2.âThe trusteeâs deed conveys to the highest bidder all rights, title, and interest in the timeshare interest that the former owner had, or had the power to convey, together with all rights, title, and interest that the former owner or his or her successors in interest acquired after the execution of the mortgage.

3.âThe issuance and recording of a trusteeâs deed shall have the same force and effect as the issuance and recording of a certificate of title by the clerk of the court in a judicial foreclosure action.

(11)âDISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS OF SALE.â

(a)âThe trustee shall apply the proceeds of the sale as follows:

1.âTo the expenses of the sale, including compensation of the trustee.

2.âTo the amount owed and set forth in the notice as required under subparagraph (6)(a)6.

3.âIf there are junior interestholders, the trustee may file an action in interpleader, pay the surplus to a court of competent jurisdiction, name the competing junior interestholders, and ask the court to determine the proper distribution of the surplus. In any interpleader action, the trustee shall recover reasonable attorneyâs fees and costs.

4.âIf there are no junior interestholders, or if all junior interestholders have been paid, any surplus shall be paid to the former owner. If the trustee is unable to locate the former owner within 1 year after the sale, the surplus, if any, shall be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer under chapter 717.

(b)âIn disposing of the proceeds of the sale, the trustee may rely on the information provided in the affidavit of the lienholder under paragraph (2)(b), and, in the event of a dispute or uncertainty over such claims, the trustee has the discretion to submit the matter to adjudication by court, by interpleader, or in any other authorized manner and shall recover reasonable attorneyâs fees and costs.

(12)âJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE ACTIONS.âThe trustee foreclosure procedure established in this section does not impair or otherwise affect the lienholderâs continuing right to bring a judicial foreclosure action, in lieu of using the trustee foreclosure procedure, with respect to any mortgage lien.

(13)âACTIONS FOR FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE TRUSTEE FORECLOSURE PROCEDURE.â

(a)âAn action for actual damages for a material violation of this section may be brought by an obligor against the lienholder for the failure to follow the trustee foreclosure procedure contained in this section.

(b)âAny trustee who intentionally violates the provisions of this section concerning the trustee foreclosure procedure commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. [775.082](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.082), s. [775.083](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.083), or s. [775.084](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.084). A trustee who incorrectly ascertains that the obligor signed the return receipt as required in subsection (5) does not violate this section if the trustee made a good faith effort to properly ascertain that it is the obligor who signed the return receipt in accordance with subsection (5).

(1)âThe Legislature finds that there are factors unique to the relationship between a mobile home owner and a mobile home park owner. Once occupancy has commenced, unique factors can affect the bargaining position of the parties and can affect the operation of market forces. Because of those unique factors, there exist inherently real and substantial differences in the relationship which distinguish it from other landlord-tenant relationships. The Legislature recognizes that mobile home owners have basic property and other rights which must be protected. The Legislature further recognizes that the mobile home park owner has a legitimate business interest in the operation of the mobile home park as part of the housing market and has basic property and other rights which must be protected. This chapter is created for the purpose of regulating the factors unique to the relationship between mobile home owners and mobile home park owners in the circumstances described herein. It recognizes that when such inequalities exist between mobile home owners and mobile home park owners as a result of such unique factors, regulation to protect those parties to the extent that they are affected by the inequalities, while preserving and protecting the rights of both parties, is required.

(2)âThere is hereby expressly preempted to the state all regulation and control of mobile home lot rents in mobile home parks and all those other matters and things relating to the landlord-tenant relationship treated by or falling within the purview of this chapter. Every unit of local government is prohibited from taking any action, including the enacting of any law, rule, regulation, or ordinance, with respect to the matters and things hereby preempted to the state.

(3)âIt is expressly declared by the Legislature that the relationship between landlord and tenant as treated by or falling within the purview of this chapter is a matter reserved to the state and that units of local government are lacking in jurisdiction and authority in regard thereto. All local statutes and ordinances in conflict herewith are expressly repealed.

(4)âIf any provision of this chapter is held invalid, it is the legislative intent that the preemption by this section shall no longer be applicable to the provision of the chapter held invalid.

(5)âNothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the enforcement of a right or duty under this section, s. [723.022](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.022), s. [723.023](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.023), s. [723.031](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.031), s.

723.006âPowers and duties of division.âIn performing its duties, the division has the following powers and duties:

(1)âThe division may make necessary public or private investigations within or outside this state to determine whether any person has violated this chapter or any rule or order hereunder, to aid in the enforcement of this chapter, or to aid in the adoption of rules or forms hereunder.

(2)âThe division may require or permit any person to file a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the division determines, as to the facts and circumstances concerning a matter to be investigated.

(3)âFor the purpose of any investigation under this chapter, the division director or any officer or employee designated by the division director may administer oaths or affirmations, subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any matter which is relevant to the investigation, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any book, document, or other tangible thing and the identity and location of any person having knowledge of relevant facts or any other matter reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of material evidence. Upon a personâs failure to obey a subpoena or to answer questions propounded by the investigating officer and upon reasonable notice to all persons affected thereby, the division may apply to the circuit court for an order compelling compliance. Financial records of a mobile home park acquired by the division pursuant to any investigation under this section are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. [119.07](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/119.07)(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. However, if the division, pursuant to a consent order, final order, or cease and desist order, makes a finding that a violation of this chapter has occurred, the financial records acquired by the division specifically relevant to that finding are no longer exempt as provided for in this subsection, unless otherwise made specifically exempt by law. âFinancial recordsâ means any financial information which is owned or controlled by the mobile home park owner and is not otherwise required to be filed with the division under other sections of this chapter.

(4)âThe division is authorized to prepare information to assist prospective mobile home owners and mobile home park owners in assessing the rights, privileges, and duties pertaining hereto.

(5)âNotwithstanding any remedies available to mobile home owners, mobile home park owners, and homeownersâ associations, if the division has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of any provision of this chapter or related rule has occurred, the division may institute enforcement proceedings in its own name against a developer, mobile home park owner, or homeownersâ association, or its assignee or agent, as follows:

(a)âThe division may permit a person whose conduct or actions may be under investigation to waive formal proceedings and enter into a consent proceeding whereby orders, rules, or letters of censure or warning, whether formal or informal, may be entered against the person.

(b)âThe division may issue an order requiring the mobile home park owner, or its assignee or agent, to cease and desist from an unlawful practice and take such affirmative action as in the judgment of the division will carry out the purposes of this chapter. The affirmative action may include the following:

1.âRefunds of rent increases, improper fees, charges and assessments, including pass-throughs and pass-ons collected in violation of the terms of this chapter.

2.âFiling and utilization of documents which correct a statutory or rule violation.

3.âReasonable action necessary to correct a statutory or rule violation.

(c)âIn determining the amount of civil penalty or affirmative action to be imposed under this section, if any, the division must consider the following factors:

1.âThe gravity of the violation.

2.âWhether the person has substantially complied with the provisions of this chapter.

3.âAny action taken by the person to correct or mitigate the violation of this chapter.

(d)âThe division may bring an action in circuit court on behalf of a class of mobile home owners, mobile home park owners, lessees, or purchasers for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, or restitution.

(e)1.âThe division may impose a civil penalty against a mobile home park owner or homeownersâ association, or its assignee or agent, for any violation of this chapter, a properly adopted park rule or regulation, or a rule adopted pursuant hereto. A penalty may be imposed on the basis of each separate violation and, if the violation is a continuing one, for each day of continuing violation, but in no event may the penalty for each separate violation or for each day of continuing violation exceed $5,000. All amounts collected shall be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer to the credit of the Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes Trust Fund.

2.âIf a violator fails to pay the civil penalty, the division shall thereupon issue an order directing that such violator cease and desist from further violation until such time as the civil penalty is paid or may pursue enforcement of the penalty in a court of competent jurisdiction. If a homeownersâ association fails to pay the civil penalty, the division shall thereupon pursue enforcement in a court of competent jurisdiction, and the order imposing the civil penalty or the cease and desist order shall not become effective until 20 days after the date of such order. Any action commenced by the division shall be brought in the county in which the division has its executive offices or in which the violation occurred.

(6)âWith regard to any written complaint alleging a violation of any provision of this chapter or any rule adopted pursuant thereto, the division shall, within 30 days after receipt of a written complaint, notify, in writing, the person who filed the complaint of the status of the complaint. Thereafter, the division shall notify the complainant of the status of the investigation within 90 days after receipt of the written complaint. Upon completion of the investigation, the division shall notify, in writing, the complainant and the party complained against of the results of the investigation and disposition of the complaint.

(7)âThe division has authority to adopt rules pursuant to ss. [120.536](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/120.536)(1) and [120.54](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/120.54) to implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter.

(8)âThe division has the authority by rule to authorize amendments permitted by this chapter to an approved prospectus or offering circular.

(9)âThe division shall adopt rules establishing a category of minor violations of this chapter or rules promulgated pursuant hereto. A minor violation means a violation which does not endanger the health, safety, or welfare of mobile home residents, which does not involve the failure to make full and fair disclosure, or which does not cause economic harm to mobile home park residents.

(10)âThe division is authorized to require disclosures to fully and fairly disclose all matters required by this chapter. If a park owner or operator, in good faith, has attempted to comply with the requirements of this chapter, and if, in fact, the park owner or operator has substantially complied with the disclosure requirements of this chapter, nonmaterial errors or omissions in the disclosure materials shall not be actionable.

(11)âUpon adoption of rules establishing minor violations and a determination by the division that the violation is a minor violation, the division may levy a civil penalty of up to $250 but shall not require a refund of rent increases, fees, charges or assessments, including pass-through and pass-ons collected from mobile home owners. Until rules have been adopted as provided in this section, the enforcement procedures of the division in existence on the effective date of this act shall be in effect.

(12)âThe division shall approve training and educational programs for board members of mobile home ownersâ associations formed and operated pursuant to s. [723.075](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.075)(1) and mobile home owners. The training may, at the divisionâs discretion, include web-based electronic media and live training and seminars in various locations throughout the state.

(13)âThe division may review and approve educational curricula and training programs for board members and mobile home owners to be offered by providers and shall maintain a current list of approved programs and providers, and make such lists available to board members in a reasonable and cost-effective manner. The cost of such programs shall be borne by the providers of the programs. The division shall establish a fee structure for the approved training programs sufficient to recover any cost incurred by the division in operating this program.

(14)âRequired education curriculum information for board member and mobile home owner training shall include:

(a)âThe provider of the training programs, which shall include the following information regarding its training and educational programs:

1.âA price list, if any, for the programs and copies of all materials.

2.âThe physical location where programs will be available, if not web-based.

3.âDates when programs will be offered.

4.âThe curriculum of the program to be offered.

(b)âThe programs shall provide information about statutory and regulatory matters relating to the board of directors of the homeownersâ association and their responsibilities to the association and to the mobile home owners in the mobile home park.

(c)âPrograms and materials may not contain editorial comments.

(d)âThe division has the right to approve and require changes to such education and training programs.

(15)âThe division shall adopt rules to implement the board member training requirements for educational programs as provided in this chapter. The Department of Business and Professional Regulation shall publish a notice of proposed rule pursuant to s. [120.54](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/120.54)(3)(a) by October 1, 2016. Such rules shall include the requirements for content and notice of the board member training program to assure that providers meet minimum training requirements.

(1)(a)âIn a mobile home park containing 26 or more lots, the park owner shall file a prospectus with the division. Prior to entering into an enforceable rental agreement for a mobile home lot, the park owner shall deliver to the homeowner a prospectus approved by the division. This subsection does not invalidate those lot rental agreements for which an approved prospectus was required to be delivered and which was delivered on or before July 1, 1986, if the mobile home park owner had:

1.âFiled a prospectus with the division prior to entering into the lot rental agreement;

2.âMade a good faith effort to correct deficiencies cited by the division by responding within the time limit set by the division, if one was set; and

3.âDelivered the approved prospectus to the mobile home owner within 45 days of approval by the division.

This paragraph does not preclude the finding that a lot rental agreement is invalid on other grounds and does not limit any rights of a mobile home owner or preclude a mobile home owner from seeking any remedies allowed by this chapter, including a determination that the lot rental agreement or any part thereof is unreasonable.

(b)âThe division shall determine whether the proposed prospectus or offering circular is adequate to meet the requirements of this chapter and shall notify the park owner by mail, within 45 days after receipt of the document, that the division has found that the prospectus or offering circular is adequate or has found specified deficiencies. If the division does not make either finding within 45 days, the prospectus shall be deemed to have been found adequate.

(c)1.âFilings for mobile home parks in which lots have not been offered for lease prior to June 4, 1984, shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $10 per lot offered for lease by the park owner; however, the fee shall not be less than $100.

(2)âThe park owner shall furnish a copy of the prospectus or offering circular together with all of the exhibits thereto to each prospective lessee. Delivery shall be made prior to execution of the lot rental agreement or at the time of occupancy, whichever occurs first. Upon delivery of a prospectus to a prospective lessee, the lot rental agreement is voidable by the lessee for a period of 15 days. However, the park owner is not required to furnish a copy of the prospectus or offering circular if the tenancy is a renewal of a tenancy and the mobile home owner has previously received the prospectus or offering circular.

(3)âThe prospectus or offering circular together with its exhibits is a disclosure document intended to afford protection to homeowners and prospective homeowners in the mobile home park. The purpose of the document is to disclose the representations of the mobile home park owner concerning the operations of the mobile home park.

(4)âWith regard to a tenancy in existence on the effective date of this chapter, the prospectus or offering circular offered by the mobile home park owner must contain the same terms and conditions as rental agreements offered to all other mobile home owners residing in the park on the effective date of this act, excepting only rent variations based upon lot location and size, and may not require any mobile home owner to install any permanent improvements, except that the mobile home owner may be required to install permanent improvements to the mobile home as disclosed in the prospectus.

(5)âThe mobile home park owner may request that the homeowner sign a receipt indicating that the homeowner has received a copy of the prospectus, the rules and regulations, and other pertinent documents so long as any such documents are clearly identified in the receipt itself. Such a receipt shall indicate nothing more than that the documents identified herein have been received by the mobile home owner. The receipt, if requested, shall be signed at the time of delivery of the identified documents. If the homeowner refuses to sign the receipt, the park owner shall still deliver to the homeowner a copy of the prospectus, rules and regulations, and any other documents which otherwise would have been delivered upon execution of the receipt. However, the homeowner shall thereafter be barred from claiming that the park owner has failed to deliver such documents. The refusal of the homeowner to sign the receipt shall under no circumstances constitute a ground for eviction of the homeowner or of a mobile home or for the imposition of any other penalty.

723.031âMobile home lot rental agreements.â

(1)âNo rental agreement shall contain any rule or regulation prohibited by this chapter, nor shall it provide for promulgation of any rule or regulation inconsistent with this chapter or amendment of any rule or regulation inconsistently with this chapter.

(2)âWhether or not a tenancy is covered by a valid written rental agreement, the required statutory provisions shall be deemed to be a part of the rental agreement.

(3)âThe homeowner shall have no financial obligation to the park owner as a condition of occupancy in the park, except the lot rental amount. The parties may agree otherwise as to user fees which the homeowner chooses to incur. No user fees shall be charged by the park owner to the mobile home owner for any services which were previously provided by the park owner and included in the lot rental amount unless there is a corresponding decrease in the lot rental amount.

(4)âNo rental agreement shall be offered by a park owner for a term of less than 1 year, and if there is no written rental agreement, no rental term shall be less than 1 year from the date of initial occupancy; however, the initial term may be less than 1 year in order to permit the park owner to have all rental agreements within the park commence at the same time. Thereafter, all terms shall be for a minimum of 1 year.

(5)âThe rental agreement must contain the lot rental amount and services included. An increase in lot rental amount upon expiration of the term of the lot rental agreement must be in accordance with ss. [723.033](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.033) and [723.037](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.037) or s. [723.059](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.059)(4), whichever is applicable; provided that, pursuant to s. [723.059](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.059)(4), the amount of the lot rental increase is disclosed and agreed to by the purchaser, in writing. An increase in lot rental amount shall not be arbitrary or discriminatory between similarly situated tenants in the park. A lot rental amount may not be increased during the term of the lot rental agreement, except:

(a)âWhen the manner of the increase is disclosed in a lot rental agreement with a term exceeding 12 months and which provides for such increases not more frequently than annually.

(b)âFor pass-through charges as defined in s. [723.003](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.003).

(c)âThat a charge may not be collected which results in payment of money for sums previously collected as part of the lot rental amount. The provisions hereof notwithstanding, the mobile home park owner may pass on, at any time during the term of the lot rental agreement, ad valorem property taxes, non-ad valorem assessments, and utility charges, or increases of either, provided that the ad valorem property taxes, non-ad valorem assessments, and utility charges are not otherwise being collected in the remainder of the lot rental amount and provided further that the passing on of such ad valorem taxes, non-ad valorem assessments, or utility charges, or increases of either, was disclosed prior to tenancy, was being passed on as a matter of custom between the mobile home park owner and the mobile home owner, or such passing on was authorized by law. A park owner is deemed to have disclosed the passing on of ad valorem property taxes and non-ad valorem assessments if ad valorem property taxes or non-ad valorem assessments were disclosed as a separate charge or a factor for increasing the lot rental amount in the prospectus or rental agreement. Such ad valorem taxes, non-ad valorem assessments, and utility charges shall be a part of the lot rental amount as defined by this chapter. The term ânon-ad valorem assessmentsâ has the same meaning as provided in s. [197.3632](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/197.3632)(1)(d). Other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, pass-on charges may be passed on only within 1 year of the date a mobile home park owner remits payment of the charge. A mobile home park owner is prohibited from passing on any fine, interest, fee, or increase in a charge resulting from a park ownerâs payment of the charge after the date such charges become delinquent. A mobile home park owner is prohibited from charging or collecting from the mobile home owners any sum for ad valorem taxes or non-ad valorem tax charges in an amount in excess of the sums remitted by the park owner to the tax collector. Nothing herein shall prohibit a park owner and a homeowner from mutually agreeing to an alternative manner of payment to the park owner of the charges.

(d)âIf a notice of increase in lot rental amount is not given 90 days before the renewal date of the rental agreement, the rental agreement must remain under the same terms until a 90-day notice of increase in lot rental amount is given. The notice may provide for a rental term shorter than 1 year in order to maintain the same renewal date.

(6)âExcept for pass-through charges, as defined in this chapter, failure on the part of the mobile home park owner or developer to disclose fully all fees, charges, or assessments prior to tenancy, unless it can be shown that such fees, charges, or assessments have been collected as a matter of custom between the mobile home park owner and the mobile home owner, shall prevent the park owner or operator from collecting said fees, charges, or assessments; and refusal by the mobile home owner to pay any such fee, charge, or assessment shall not be used by the park owner or developer as a cause for eviction in any court of law.

(7)âNo park owner may increase the lot rental amount until an approved prospectus has been delivered if one is required. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit those increases in lot rental amount for those lot rental agreements for which an approved prospectus was required to be delivered and which was delivered on or before July 1, 1986, if the mobile home park owner had:

(a)âFiled a prospectus with the division prior to entering into the lot rental agreement;

(b)âMade a good faith effort to correct deficiencies cited by the division by responding within the time limit set by the division, if one was set; and

(c)âDelivered the approved prospectus to the mobile home owner within 45 days of approval by the division.

This subsection shall not preclude the finding that a lot rental increase is invalid on other grounds and shall not be construed to limit any rights of a mobile home owner or to preclude a mobile home owner from seeking any remedies allowed by this chapter, including a determination that the lot rental agreement or any part thereof is unreasonable.

(8)âIf a mobile home owner has deposited or advanced money on a rental agreement as security for performance of the rental agreement, which money is held in excess of 3 months by the mobile home park owner or his or her agent, such deposit shall be handled pursuant to s. [83.49](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/83.49).

(9)âNo rental agreement shall provide for the eviction of a mobile home owner on a ground other than one contained in s. [723.061](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.061).

(10)âThe rules and regulations and the prospectus shall be deemed to be incorporated into the rental agreement.

(d)âLimit the application of the unreasonable provision so as to avoid any unreasonable result.

(e)âAward a refund or a reduction in future rent payments.

(f)âAward such other equitable relief as deemed necessary.

(2)âWhen it is claimed or appears to the court that a lot rental amount, rent increase, or change, or any provision thereof, may be unreasonable, the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its meaning and purpose, the relationship of the parties, and other relevant factors to aid the court in making the determination.

(3)âFor the purposes of this section, a lot rental amount that is in excess of market rent shall be considered unreasonable.

(4)âMarket rent means that rent which would result from market forces absent an unequal bargaining position between mobile home park owners and mobile home owners.

(5)âIn determining market rent, the court may consider rents charged by comparable mobile home parks in its competitive area. To be comparable, a mobile home park must offer similar facilities, services, amenities, and management.

(6)âIn determining whether a rent increase or resulting lot rental amount is unreasonable, the court may consider economic or other factors, including, but not limited to, increases or decreases in the consumer price index, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor; increases or decreases in operating costs or taxes; and prior disclosures.

(7)âAn arbitrator or mediator under ss. [723.037](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.037), [723.038](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.038), and [723.0381](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.0381) shall employ the same standards as set forth in this section.

723.037âLot rental increases; reduction in services or utilities; change in rules and regulations; mediation.â

(1)âA park owner shall give written notice to each affected mobile home owner and the board of directors of the homeownersâ association, if one has been formed, at least 90 days before any increase in lot rental amount or reduction in services or utilities provided by the park owner or change in rules and regulations. The park owner may give notice of all increases in lot rental amount for multiple anniversary dates in the same 90-day notice. The notice must identify all other affected homeowners, which may be by lot number, name, group, or phase. If the affected homeowners are not identified by name, the park owner shall make the names and addresses available upon request. However, this requirement does not authorize the release of the names, addresses, or other private information about the homeowners to the association or any other person for any other purpose. The home ownerâs right to the 90-day notice may not be waived or precluded by a home owner, or the homeownersâ committee, in an agreement with the park owner. Rules adopted as a result of restrictions imposed by governmental entities and required to protect the public health, safety, and welfare may be enforced prior to the expiration of the 90-day period but are not otherwise exempt from the requirements of this chapter. Pass-through charges must be separately listed as to the amount of the charge, the name of the governmental entity mandating the capital improvement, and the nature or type of the pass-through charge being levied. Notices of increase in the lot rental amount due to a pass-through charge must state the additional payment and starting and ending dates of each pass-through charge. The homeownersâ association shall have no standing to challenge the increase in lot rental amount, reduction in services or utilities, or change of rules and regulations unless a majority of the affected homeowners agree, in writing, to such representation.

(2)âNotice as required by this section shall, in addition to the information required in subsection (1), only be required to include the dollar amount of the relevant portions of the present lot rental amount that are being increased and the dollar amount of the proposed increases in lot rental amount if there is an increase in the lot rental amount, the reduction in services or utilities, or the change in rules and regulations and the effective date thereof.

(3)âThe park owner shall file annually with the division a copy of any notice of a lot rental amount increase. The notice shall be filed on or before January 1 of each year for any notice given during the preceding year. If the actual increase is an amount less than the proposed amount stated in the notice, the park owner shall notify the division of the actual amount of the increase within 30 days of the effective date of the increase or at the time of filing, whichever is later.

(4)(a)âA committee, not to exceed five in number, designated by a majority of the affected mobile home owners or by the board of directors of the homeownersâ association, if applicable, and the park owner shall meet, at a mutually convenient time and place no later than 60 days before the effective date of the change to discuss the reasons for the increase in lot rental amount, reduction in services or utilities, or change in rules and regulations. The negotiating committee shall make a written request for a meeting with the park owner or subdivision developer to discuss those matters addressed in the 90-day notice, and may include in the request a listing of any other issue, with supporting documentation, that the committee intends to raise and discuss at the meeting. The committee shall address all lot rental amount increases that are specified in the notice of lot rental amount increase, regardless of the effective date of the increase.

(b)1.âAt the meeting, the park owner or subdivision developer shall in good faith disclose and explain all material factors resulting in the decision to increase the lot rental amount, reduce services or utilities, or change rules and regulations, including how those factors justify the specific change proposed. The park owner or subdivision developer may not limit the discussion of the reasons for the change to generalities only, such as, but not limited to, increases in operational costs, changes in economic conditions, or rents charged by comparable mobile home parks. For example, if the reason for an increase in lot rental amount is an increase in operational costs, the park owner must disclose the item or items which have increased, the amount of the increase, any similar item or items which have decreased, and the amount of the decrease. If an increase is based upon the lot rental amount charged by comparable mobile home parks, the park owner shall disclose, and provide in writing to the committee at or before the meeting, the name, address, lot rental amount, and any other relevant factors relied upon by the park owner, such as facilities, services, and amenities, concerning the comparable mobile home parks. The information concerning comparable mobile home parks to be exchanged by the parties is to encourage a dialogue concerning the reasons used by the park owner for the increase in lot rental amount and to encourage the home owners to evaluate and discuss the reasons for those changes with the park owner. The park owner shall prepare a written summary of the material factors and retain a copy for 3 years. The park owner shall provide the committee a copy of the summary at or before the meeting.

2.âThe park owner shall not limit the comparable mobile home park disclosure to those mobile home parks that are owned or operated by the same owner or operator as the subject park, except in certain circumstances, which include, but are not limited to:

a.âThat the market area for comparable mobile home parks includes mobile home parks owned or operated by the same entity that have similar facilities, services, and amenities;

b.âThat the subject mobile home park has unique attributes that are shared with similar mobile home parks;

c.âThat the mobile home park is located in a geographic or market area that contains few comparable mobile home parks; or

d.âThat there are similar considerations or factors that would be considered in such a market analysis by a competent professional and would be considered in determining the valuation of the market rent.

(c)âIf the committee disagrees with a park ownerâs lot rental amount increase based upon comparable mobile home parks, the committee shall disclose to the park owner the name, address, lot rental amount, and any other relevant factors relied upon by the committee, such as facilities, services, and amenities, concerning the comparable mobile home parks. The committee shall provide to the park owner the disclosure, in writing, within 15 days after the meeting with the park owner, together with a request for a second meeting. The park owner shall meet with the committee at a mutually convenient time and place within 30 days after receipt by the park owner of the request from the committee to discuss the disclosure provided by the committee. At the second meeting, the park owner may take into account the information on comparable parks provided by the committee, may supplement the information provided to the committee at the first meeting, and may modify his or her position, but the park owner may not change the information provided to the committee at the first meeting.

(d)âThe committee and the park owner may mutually agree, in writing, to extend or continue any meetings required by this section.

(e)âEither party may prepare and use additional information to support its position during or subsequent to the meetings required by this section.

This subsection is not intended to be enforced by civil or administrative action. Rather, the meetings and discussions are intended to be in the nature of settlement discussions prior to the parties proceeding to mediation of any dispute.

(5)(a)âWithin 30 days after the date of the last scheduled meeting described in subsection (4), the homeowners may petition the division to initiate mediation of the dispute pursuant to s. [723.038](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.038) if a majority of the affected homeowners have designated, in writing, that:

1.âThe rental increase is unreasonable;

2.âThe rental increase has made the lot rental amount unreasonable;

3.âThe decrease in services or utilities is not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in rent or is otherwise unreasonable; or

4.âThe change in the rules and regulations is unreasonable.

(b)âA park owner, within the same time period, may also petition the division to initiate mediation of the dispute.

(c)âWhen a dispute involves a rental increase for different home owners and there are different rates or different rental terms for those home owners, all such rent increases in a calendar year for one mobile home park may be considered in one mediation proceeding.

(d)âAt mediation, the park owner and the homeowners committee may supplement the information provided to each other at the meetings described in subsection (4) and may modify their position, but they may not change the information provided to each other at the first and second meetings.

The purpose of this subsection is to encourage discussion and evaluation by the parties of the comparable mobile home parks in the competitive market area. The requirements of this subsection are not intended to be enforced by civil or administrative action. Rather, the meetings and discussions are intended to be in the nature of settlement discussions prior to the parties proceeding to litigation of any dispute.

(6)âIf a party requests mediation and the opposing party refuses to agree to mediate upon proper request, the party refusing to mediate shall not be entitled to attorneyâs fees in any action relating to a dispute described in this section.

(7)âThe term âparties,â for purposes of mediation under this section and s. [723.038](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.038), means a park owner and a homeownersâ committee selected pursuant to this section.

723.038âDispute settlement; mediation.â

(1)âEither party may petition the division to appoint a mediator and initiate mediation proceedings.

(2)âThe division upon petition shall appoint a qualified mediator to conduct mediation proceedings unless the parties timely notify the division in writing that they have selected a mediator. A person appointed by the division shall be a qualified mediator from a list of circuit court mediators in each judicial circuit who has met training and educational requirements established by the Supreme Court. If such mediators are not available, the division may select a mediator from the list maintained by the Florida Growth Management Conflict Resolution Consortium. The division shall promulgate rules of procedure to govern such proceedings in accordance with the rules of practice and procedure adopted by the Supreme Court. The division shall also establish, by rule, the fee to be charged by a mediator which shall not exceed the fee authorized by the circuit court.

(3)âA mediator appointed by the division or selected by the parties shall comply with the rules adopted by the division. The mediator shall also notify the division in writing within 10 days after the conclusion of the mediation, that the mediation has been concluded.

(4)âUpon receiving a petition to mediate a dispute, the division shall, within 20 days, notify the parties that a mediator has been appointed by the division. The parties may accept the mediator appointed by the division or, within 30 days, select a mediator to mediate the dispute. The parties shall each pay a $250 filing fee to the mediator appointed by the division or selected by the parties, within 30 days after the division notifies the parties of the appointment of the mediator. The $250 filing fee shall be used by the mediator to defray the hourly rate charged for mediation of the dispute. Any portion of the filing fee not used shall be refunded to the parties.

(5)âThe parties may agree to select their own mediator, and such mediation shall be governed by the rules of procedure established by the division. The parties, by agreement, may waive mediation, or the petitioning party may withdraw the petition prior to mediation. Upon the conclusion of the mediation, the mediator shall notify the division that the mediation has been concluded.

(6)âNo resolution arising from a mediation proceeding as provided for in s. [723.037](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.037) or this section shall be deemed final agency action. Any party, however, may initiate an action in the circuit court to enforce a resolution or agreement arising from a mediation proceeding which has been reduced to writing. The court shall consider such resolution or agreement to be a contract for the purpose of providing a remedy to the complaining party.

(7)âMediation pursuant to this section is an informal and nonadversarial process. Either party may submit to the opposing party at least 10 days prior to mediation a written request for information.

(8)âEach party involved in the mediation proceeding has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent any person present at the proceeding from disclosing, communications made during such proceeding, whether or not the dispute was successfully resolved. This subsection shall not be construed to prevent or inhibit the discovery or admissibility of any information which is otherwise subject to discovery or admission under applicable law or rules of court. There is no privilege as to communications made in furtherance of the commission of a crime or fraud or as part of a plan to commit a crime or a fraud. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed so as to permit an individual to obtain immunity from prosecution for criminal conduct.

(9)âA mediator appointed pursuant to this section shall have judicial immunity in the same manner and to the same extent as a judge.

(1)(a)âEntrance fees on new mobile home placements shall be specifically set forth in the prospectus or offering circular. Any such fee shall be clearly identified in writing at the time that the rental agreement is signed or otherwise concluded.

(b)âThe failure on the part of a mobile home park owner or developer to disclose fully all fees, charges, or assessments shall prevent the park owner or operator from collecting such fees, charges, or assessments; and a refusal by the mobile home owner to pay any undisclosed charge shall not be used by the park owner or developer as a cause for eviction in any court of law.

(c)âIt is unlawful for any mobile home park owner or developer to make any agreement, written or oral, whereby the fees authorized in this subsection will be split between such mobile home park owner or developer and any mobile home dealer, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this paragraph is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. [775.082](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.082) or s. [775.083](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/775.083).

(d)âWith respect to the first rental agreement for a mobile home lot in a developing park, the park has the right to condition such initial rental agreement upon the prospective residentâs purchasing the mobile home from a dealer chosen by the park developer. A park developer may also buy down rentals on the initial rental agreement of a mobile home lot, and such buy-downs may be split between the owner of a developing park and the dealer.

(e)âWhenever an entrance fee is charged by a mobile home park owner or developer for the entrance of a mobile home into the park and such mobile home is moved from the park before 2 years have passed from the date on which the fee was charged, the fee shall be prorated and a portion returned as follows:

1.âThe entrance fee shall be refunded at the rate of one twenty-fourth of such fee for each month short of 2 years that the mobile home owner maintained his or her mobile home within the park.

2.âThe entrance fee shall be refunded within 15 days after the mobile home has been physically moved from the park.

No new entrance fee may be charged for a move within the same park. This paragraph does not apply in instances in which the mobile home owner is evicted on the ground of nonpayment of rent; violation of a federal, state, or local ordinance; or violation of a properly promulgated park rule or regulation or leaves before the expiration date of his or her rental agreement. However, the sums due to the park by the mobile home owner may be offset against the balance due on the entrance fee.

(2)âNo person shall be required by a mobile home park owner to pay an exit fee upon termination of his or her residency.

(3)âNo entrance fee may be charged by the park owner to the purchaser of a mobile home situated in the park that is offered for sale by a resident of the park.

(4)âExcept as expressly preempted by the requirements of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, a mobile home owner or the park owner shall be authorized pursuant to this section to site any size new or used mobile home and appurtenances on a mobile home lot in accordance with the lot sizes, separation and setback distances, and other requirements in effect at the time of the approval of the mobile home park.

(5)âA mobile home park that is damaged or destroyed due to wind, water, or other natural force may be rebuilt on the same site with the same density as was approved, permitted, and built before the park was damaged or destroyed.

(6)âThis section does not limit the regulation of the uniform firesafety standards established under s. [633.206](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/633.206), but supersedes any other density, separation, setback, or lot size regulation adopted after initial permitting and construction of the mobile home park.

(1)âThe purchaser of a mobile home within a mobile home park may become a tenant of the park if such purchaser would otherwise qualify with the requirements of entry into the park under the park rules and regulations, subject to the approval of the park owner, but such approval may not be unreasonably withheld. The purchaser of the mobile home may cancel or rescind the contract for purchase of the mobile home if the purchaserâs tenancy has not been approved by the park owner 5 days before the closing of the purchase.

(2)âProperly promulgated rules may provide for the screening of any prospective purchaser to determine whether or not such purchaser is qualified to become a tenant of the park.

(3)âThe purchaser of a mobile home who intends to become a resident of the mobile home park in accordance with this section has the right to assume the remainder of the term of any rental agreement then in effect between the mobile home park owner and the seller and may assume the sellerâs prospectus. However, nothing herein shall prohibit a mobile home park owner from offering the purchaser of a mobile home any approved prospectus.

(4)âHowever, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a mobile home park owner from increasing the rental amount to be paid by the purchaser upon the expiration of the assumed rental agreement in an amount deemed appropriate by the mobile home park owner, so long as such increase is disclosed to the purchaser prior to his or her occupancy and is imposed in a manner consistent with the purchaserâs prospectus and this act.

(5)âLifetime leases and the renewal provisions in automatically renewable leases, both those existing and those entered into after July 1, 1986, are not assumable unless otherwise provided in the mobile home lot rental agreement or unless the transferee is the home ownerâs spouse. The right to an assumption of the lease by a spouse may be exercised only one time during the term of that lease.

723.061âEviction; grounds, proceedings.â

(1)âA mobile home park owner may evict a mobile home owner, a mobile home tenant, a mobile home occupant, or a mobile home only on one or more of the following grounds:

(a)âNonpayment of the lot rental amount. If a mobile home owner or tenant, whichever is responsible, fails to pay the lot rental amount when due and if the default continues for 5 days after delivery of a written demand by the mobile home park owner for payment of the lot rental amount, the park owner may terminate the tenancy. However, if the mobile home owner or tenant, whichever is responsible, pays the lot rental amount due, including any late charges, court costs, and attorneyâs fees, the court may, for good cause, deny the order of eviction, if such nonpayment has not occurred more than twice.

(b)âConviction of a violation of a federal or state law or local ordinance, if the violation is detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of other residents of the mobile home park. The mobile home owner or mobile home tenant must vacate the premises within 7 days after the date the notice to vacate is delivered. This paragraph constitutes grounds to deny an initial tenancy of a purchaser of a home under paragraph (e) or to evict an unapproved occupant of a home.

(c)âViolation of a park rule or regulation, the rental agreement, or this chapter.

1.âFor the first violation of any properly promulgated rule or regulation, rental agreement provision, or this chapter which is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to have been an act that endangered the life, health, safety, or property of the park residents or employees or the peaceful enjoyment of the mobile home park by its residents, the mobile home park owner may terminate the rental agreement, and the mobile home owner, tenant, or occupant must vacate the premises within 7 days after the notice to vacate is delivered.

2.âFor a second violation of the same properly promulgated rule or regulation, rental agreement provision, or this chapter within 12 months, the mobile home park owner may terminate the tenancy if she or he has given the mobile home owner, tenant, or occupant written notice, within 30 days after the first violation, which specified the actions of the mobile home owner, tenant, or occupant that caused the violation and gave the mobile home owner, tenant, or occupant 7 days to correct the noncompliance. The mobile home owner, tenant, or occupant must have received written notice of the ground upon which she or he is to be evicted at least 30 days prior to the date on which she or he is required to vacate. A second violation of a properly promulgated rule or regulation, rental agreement provision, or this chapter within 12 months of the first violation is unequivocally a ground for eviction, and it is not a defense to any eviction proceeding that a violation has been cured after the second violation. Violation of a rule or regulation, rental agreement provision, or this chapter more than 1 year after the first violation of the same rule or regulation, rental agreement provision, or this chapter does not constitute a ground for eviction under this section.

A properly promulgated rule or regulation may not be arbitrarily applied and used as a ground for eviction.

(d)âChange in use of the land comprising the mobile home park, or the portion thereof from which mobile homes are to be evicted, from mobile home lot rentals to some other use, if:

1.âThe park owner gives written notice to the homeownersâ association formed and operating under ss. [723.075](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.075)-[723.079](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.079) of its right to purchase the mobile home park, if the land comprising the mobile home park is changing use from mobile home lot rentals to a different use, at the price and under the terms and conditions set forth in the written notice.

a.âThe notice shall be delivered to the officers of the homeownersâ association by United States mail. Within 45 days after the date of mailing of the notice, the homeownersâ association may execute and deliver a contract to the park owner to purchase the mobile home park at the price and under the terms and conditions set forth in the notice. If the contract between the park owner and the homeownersâ association is not executed and delivered to the park owner within the 45-day period, the park owner is under no further obligation to the homeownersâ association except as provided in sub-subparagraph b.

b.âIf the park owner elects to offer or sell the mobile home park at a price lower than the price specified in her or his initial notice to the officers of the homeownersâ association, the homeownersâ association has an additional 10 days to meet the revised price, terms, and conditions of the park owner by executing and delivering a revised contract to the park owner.

c.âThe park owner is not obligated under this subparagraph or s. [723.071](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.071) to give any other notice to, or to further negotiate with, the homeownersâ association for the sale of the mobile home park to the homeownersâ association after 6 months after the date of the mailing of the initial notice under sub-subparagraph a.

2.âThe park owner gives the affected mobile home owners and tenants at least 6 monthsâ notice of the eviction due to the projected change in use and of their need to secure other accommodations. Within 20 days after giving an eviction notice to a mobile home owner, the park owner must provide the division with a copy of the notice. The division must provide the executive director of the Florida Mobile Home Relocation Corporation with a copy of the notice.

a.âThe notice of eviction due to a change in use of the land must include in a font no smaller than the body of the notice the following statement:

YOU MAY BE ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION FROM THE FLORIDA MOBILE HOME RELOCATION TRUST FUND, ADMINISTERED BY THE FLORIDA MOBILE HOME RELOCATION CORPORATION (FMHRC). FMHRC CONTACT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE FROM THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL REGULATION.

b.âThe park owner may not give a notice of increase in lot rental amount within 90 days before giving notice of a change in use.

(e)âFailure of the purchaser, prospective tenant, or occupant of a mobile home situated in the mobile home park to be qualified as, and to obtain approval to become, a tenant or occupant of the home, if such approval is required by a properly promulgated rule. If a purchaser or prospective tenant of a mobile home situated in the mobile home park occupies the mobile home before such approval is granted, the mobile home owner or mobile home tenant must vacate the premises within 7 days after the date the notice of the failure to be approved for tenancy is delivered.

(2)âIn the event of eviction for a change in use, homeowners must object to the change in use by petitioning for administrative or judicial remedies within 90 days after the date of the notice or they will be barred from taking any subsequent action to contest the change in use. This subsection does not prevent any homeowner from objecting to a zoning change at any time.

(3)âA mobile home park owner applying for the removal of a mobile home owner, tenant, or occupant or a mobile home shall file, in the county court in the county where the mobile home lot is situated, a complaint describing the lot and stating the facts that authorize the removal of the mobile home owner, tenant, or occupant or the mobile home. The park owner is entitled to the summary procedure provided in s. [51.011](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/51.011), and the court shall advance the cause on the calendar.

(4)âExcept for the notice to the officers of the homeownersâ association under subparagraph (1)(d)1., any notice required by this section must be in writing, and must be posted on the premises and sent to the mobile home owner and tenant or occupant, as appropriate, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the mobile home owner and tenant or occupant, as appropriate, at her or his last known address. Delivery of the mailed notice shall be deemed given 5 days after the date of postmark.

(5)âA park owner who accepts payment of any portion of the lot rental amount with actual knowledge of noncompliance after notice and termination of the rental agreement due to a violation under paragraph (1)(b), paragraph (1)(c), or paragraph (1)(e) does not waive the right to terminate the rental agreement or the right to bring a civil action for the noncompliance, but not for any subsequent or continuing noncompliance. Any rent so received must be accounted for at the final hearing.

(1)âIn an action for possession, after entry of judgment in favor of the mobile home park owner, the clerk shall issue a writ of possession to the sheriff, describing the lot or premises and commanding the sheriff to put the mobile home park owner in possession. The writ of possession shall not issue earlier than 10 days from the date judgment is granted.

(2)âAt the time the sheriff executes the writ of possession, the landlord or the landlordâs agent may remove any personal property, including the mobile home, found on the premises to or near the property line or, in the case of the mobile home, into storage. If requested by the landlord, the sheriff shall stand by to keep the peace while the landlord removes personal property. When such a request is made, the sheriff may charge a reasonable hourly rate, and the person requesting the sheriff to stand by to keep the peace shall be responsible for paying the reasonable hourly rate set by the sheriff. Neither the sheriff nor the landlord nor his or her agent shall be responsible to the tenant or any other party for loss, destruction, or damage to the property after it has been removed.

(1)âIn any action based upon nonpayment of rent or seeking to recover unpaid rent, or a portion thereof, the mobile home owner may defend upon the ground of a material noncompliance with any portion of this chapter or may raise any other defense, whether legal or equitable, which he or she may have. The defense of material noncompliance may be raised by the mobile home owner only if 7 days have elapsed after he or she has notified the park owner in writing of his or her intention not to pay rent, or a portion thereof, based upon the park ownerâs noncompliance with portions of this chapter, specifying in reasonable detail the provisions in default. A material noncompliance with this chapter by the park owner is a complete defense to an action for possession based upon nonpayment of rent, or a portion thereof, and, upon hearing, the court or the jury, as the case may be, shall determine the amount, if any, by which the rent is to be reduced to reflect the diminution in value of the lot during the period of noncompliance with any portion of this chapter. After consideration of all other relevant issues, the court shall enter appropriate judgment.

(2)âIn any action by the park owner or a mobile home owner brought under subsection (1), the mobile home owner shall pay into the registry of the court that portion of the accrued rent, if any, relating to the claim of material noncompliance as alleged in the complaint, or as determined by the court. The court shall notify the mobile home owner of such requirement. The failure of the mobile home owner to pay the rent, or portion thereof, into the registry of the court as required herein constitutes an absolute waiver of the mobile home ownerâs defenses other than payment, and the park owner is entitled to an immediate default.

(3)âWhen the mobile home owner has deposited funds into the registry of the court in accordance with the provisions of this section and the park owner is in actual danger of loss of the premises or other personal hardship resulting from the loss of rental income from the premises, the park owner may apply to the court for disbursement of all or part of the funds or for prompt final hearing, whereupon the court shall advance the cause on the calendar. The court, after preliminary hearing, may award all or any portion of the funds on deposit to the park owner or may proceed immediately to a final resolution of the cause.

(e)âA particular sale or transfer of such park is exempted from the provisions of this section and s. [723.071](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.071).

Any party acquiring an interest in a mobile home park, and any and all title insurance companies and attorneys preparing, furnishing, or examining any evidence of title, have the absolute right to rely on the truth and accuracy of all statements appearing in such affidavit and are under no obligation to inquire further as to any matter or fact relating to the park ownerâs compliance with the provisions of s.

723.078âBylaws of homeownersâ associations.â

(1)âThe directors of the association and the operation shall be governed by the bylaws.

(2)âThe bylaws shall provide and, if they do not, shall be deemed to include, the following provisions:

(a)âAdministration.âThe form of administration of the association shall be described, providing for the titles of the officers and for a board of directors and specifying the powers, duties, manner of selection and removal, and compensation, if any, of officers and board members. Unless otherwise provided in the bylaws, the board of directors shall be composed of five members. The board of directors shall elect a president, secretary, and treasurer who shall perform the duties of those offices customarily performed by officers of corporations, and these officers shall serve without compensation and at the pleasure of the board of directors. The board of directors may elect and designate other officers and grant them those duties it deems appropriate.

(b)âQuorum; voting requirements; proxies.â

1.âUnless otherwise provided in the bylaws, 30 percent of the total membership is required to constitute a quorum. Decisions shall be made by a majority of members represented at a meeting at which a quorum is present.

2.a.âA member may not vote by general proxy but may vote by limited proxies substantially conforming to a limited proxy form adopted by the division. Limited proxies and general proxies may be used to establish a quorum. Limited proxies may be used for votes taken to amend the articles of incorporation or bylaws pursuant to this section, and any other matters for which this chapter requires or permits a vote of members. A proxy, limited or general, may not be used in the election of board members in general elections or elections to fill vacancies caused by recall, resignation, or otherwise. Board members must be elected by written ballot or by voting in person. If a mobile home or subdivision lot is owned jointly, the owners of the mobile home or subdivision lot must be counted as one for the purpose of determining the number of votes required for a majority. Only one vote per mobile home or subdivision lot shall be counted. Any number greater than 50 percent of the total number of votes constitutes a majority. Notwithstanding this section, members may vote in person at member meetings or by secret ballot, including absentee ballots, as defined by the division.

b.âElections shall be decided by a plurality of the ballots cast. There is no quorum requirement; however, at least 20 percent of the eligible voters must cast a ballot in order to have a valid election. A member may not allow any other person to cast his or her ballot, and any ballots improperly cast are invalid. An election is not required unless there are more candidates nominated than vacancies that exist on the board.

c.âEach member or other eligible person who desires to be a candidate for the board of directors shall appear on the ballot in alphabetical order by surname. A ballot may not indicate if any of the candidates are incumbent on the board. All ballots must be uniform in appearance. Write-in candidates and more than one vote per candidate per ballot are not allowed. A ballot may not provide a space for the signature of, or any other means of identifying, a voter. If a ballot contains more votes than vacancies or fewer votes than vacancies, the ballot is invalid unless otherwise stated in the bylaws.

d.âAn impartial committee shall be responsible for overseeing the election process and complying with all ballot requirements. For purposes of this section, the term âimpartial committeeâ means a committee whose members do not include any of the following people or their spouses:

(I)âCurrent board members.

(II)âCurrent association officers.

(III)âCandidates for the association or board.

e.âThe association bylaws shall provide a method for determining the winner of an election in which two or more candidates for the same position receive the same number of votes.

f.âThe division shall adopt procedural rules to govern elections, including, but not limited to, rules for providing notice by electronic transmission and rules for maintaining the secrecy of ballots.

3.âA proxy is effective only for the specific meeting for which originally given and any lawfully adjourned meetings thereof. In no event shall any proxy be valid for a period longer than 90 days after the date of the first meeting for which it was given. Every proxy shall be revocable at any time at the pleasure of the member executing it.

4.âA member of the board of directors or a committee may submit in writing his or her agreement or disagreement with any action taken at a meeting that the member did not attend. This agreement or disagreement may not be used as a vote for or against the action taken and may not be used for the purposes of creating a quorum.

(c)âBoard of directorsâ and committee meetings.â

1.âMeetings of the board of directors and meetings of its committees at which a quorum is present shall be open to all members. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the requirement that board meetings and committee meetings be open to the members does not apply to meetings between the park owner and the board of directors or any of the boardâs committees, board or committee meetings held for the purpose of discussing personnel matters, or meetings between the board or a committee and the associationâs attorney, with respect to potential or pending litigation, when the meeting is held for the purpose of seeking or rendering legal advice, and when the contents of the discussion would otherwise be governed by the attorney-client privilege. Notice of all meetings open to members shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon the park property at least 48 hours in advance, except in an emergency. Notice of any meeting in which dues are to be considered for any reason shall specifically contain a statement that dues will be considered and the nature of such dues.

2.âA board or committee memberâs participation in a meeting via telephone, real-time videoconferencing, or similar real-time telephonic, electronic, or video communication counts toward a quorum, and such member may vote as if physically present. A speaker shall be used so that the conversation of those board or committee members attending by telephone may be heard by the board or committee members attending in person, as well as by members present at a meeting.

3.âMembers of the board of directors may use e-mail as a means of communication but may not cast a vote on an association matter via e-mail.

4.âThe right to attend meetings of the board of directors and its committees includes the right to speak at such meetings with reference to all designated agenda items. The association may adopt reasonable written rules governing the frequency, duration, and manner of membersâ statements. Any item not included on the notice may be taken up on an emergency basis by at least a majority plus one of the members of the board. Such emergency action shall be noticed and ratified at the next regular meeting of the board. Any member may tape record or videotape meetings of the board of directors and its committees, except meetings between the board of directors or its appointed homeownersâ committee and the park owner. The division shall adopt reasonable rules governing the tape recording and videotaping of the meeting.

5.âExcept as provided in paragraph (i), a vacancy occurring on the board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of the majority of the remaining directors, even though the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum; by the sole remaining director; if the vacancy is not so filled or if no director remains, by the members; or, on the application of any person, by the circuit court of the county in which the registered office of the corporation is located.

6.âThe term of a director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy expires at the next annual meeting at which directors are elected. A directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by the board of directors, but only for the term of office continuing until the next election of directors by the members.

7.âA vacancy that will occur at a specific later date, by reason of a resignation effective at a later date, may be filled before the vacancy occurs. However, the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.

8.a.âThe officers and directors of the association have a fiduciary relationship to the members.

b.âA director and committee member shall discharge his or her duties in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.

9.âIn discharging his or her duties, a director may rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by:

a.âOne or more officers or employees of the corporation who the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;

b.âLegal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the personsâ professional or expert competence; or

c.âA committee of the board of directors of which he or she is not a member if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.

10.âA director is not acting in good faith if he or she has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by subparagraph 9. unwarranted.

11.âA director is not liable for any action taken as a director, or any failure to take any action, if he or she performed the duties of his or her office in compliance with this section.

(d)âMember meetings.âMembers shall meet at least once each calendar year, and the meeting shall be the annual meeting. All members of the board of directors shall be elected at the annual meeting unless the bylaws provide for staggered election terms or for their election at another meeting. The bylaws shall not restrict any member desiring to be a candidate for board membership from being nominated from the floor. All nominations from the floor must be made at a duly noticed meeting of the members held at least 27 days before the annual meeting. The bylaws shall provide the method for calling the meetings of the members, including annual meetings. The method shall provide at least 14 daysâ written notice to each member in advance of the meeting and require the posting in a conspicuous place on the park property of a notice of the meeting at least 14 days prior to the meeting. The right to receive written notice of membership meetings may be waived in writing by a member. Unless waived, the notice of the annual meeting shall be mailed, hand delivered, or electronically transmitted to each member, and shall constitute notice. Unless otherwise stated in the bylaws, an officer of the association shall provide an affidavit affirming that the notices were mailed, hand delivered, or provided by electronic transmission in accordance with this section to each member at the address last furnished to the corporation. These meeting requirements do not prevent members from waiving notice of meetings or from acting by written agreement without meetings, if allowed by the bylaws.

(e)âMinutes of meetings.â

1.âNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the minutes of board or committee meetings that are closed to members are privileged and confidential and are not available for inspection or photocopying.

2.âMinutes of all meetings of members of an association and meetings open to members of the board of directors and a committee of the board must be maintained in written form and approved by the members, board, or committee, as applicable. A vote or abstention from voting on each matter voted upon for each director present at a board meeting must be recorded in the minutes.

3.âAll approved minutes of open meetings of members, committees, and the board of directors shall be kept in a businesslike manner and shall be available for inspection by members, or their authorized representatives, and board members at reasonable times. The association shall retain these minutes within this state for at least 5 years.

(f)âManner of sharing assessments.âThe share or percentage of, and manner of sharing, assessments and expenses for each member shall be stated.

(g)âAnnual budget.âIf the bylaws provide for adoption of an annual budget by the members, the board of directors shall mail a meeting notice and copies of the proposed annual budget of expenses to the members at least 30 days before the meeting at which the budget will be considered. If the bylaws provide that the budget may be adopted by the board of directors, the members shall be given written notice of the time and place at which the meeting of the board of directors to consider the budget will be held. The meeting shall be open to the members. If the bylaws do not provide for adoption of an annual budget, this paragraph shall not apply.

(h)âAmendment of articles of incorporation and bylaws.â

1.âThe method by which the articles of incorporation and bylaws may be amended consistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be stated. If the bylaws fail to provide a method of amendment, the bylaws may be amended by the board of directors and approved by a majority of members at a meeting at which a quorum is present. No bylaw shall be revised or amended by reference to its title or number only.

2.âNotwithstanding any other provision of this section, if an amendment to the articles of incorporation or the bylaws is required by any action of any federal, state, or local governmental authority or agency, or any law, ordinance, or rule thereof, the board of directors may, by a majority vote of the board, at a duly noticed meeting of the board, amend the articles of incorporation or bylaws without a vote of the membership.

(i)âRecall of board members.âAny member of the board of directors may be recalled and removed from office with or without cause by the vote of or agreement in writing by a majority of all members. A special meeting of the members to recall a member or members of the board of directors may be called by 10 percent of the members giving notice of the meeting as required for a meeting of members, and the notice shall state the purpose of the meeting. Electronic transmission may not be used as a method of giving notice of a meeting called in whole or in part for this purpose.

1.âIf the recall is approved by a majority of all members by a vote at a meeting, the recall is effective as provided in this paragraph. The board shall duly notice and hold a board meeting within 5 full business days after the adjournment of the member meeting to recall one or more board members. At the meeting, the board shall either certify the recall, in which case such member or members shall be recalled effective immediately and shall turn over to the board within 5 full business days any and all records and property of the association in their possession, or shall proceed under subparagraph 3.

2.âIf the proposed recall is by an agreement in writing by a majority of all members, the agreement in writing or a copy thereof shall be served on the association by certified mail or by personal service in the manner authorized by chapter 48 and the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. The board of directors shall duly notice and hold a meeting of the board within 5 full business days after receipt of the agreement in writing. At the meeting, the board shall either certify the written agreement to recall members of the board, in which case such members shall be recalled effective immediately and shall turn over to the board, within 5 full business days, any and all records and property of the association in their possession, or shall proceed as described in subparagraph 3.

3.âIf the board determines not to certify the written agreement to recall members of the board, or does not certify the recall by a vote at a meeting, the board shall, within 5 full business days after the board meeting, file with the division a petition for binding arbitration pursuant to the procedures of s. [723.1255](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.1255). For purposes of this paragraph, the members who voted at the meeting or who executed the agreement in writing shall constitute one party under the petition for arbitration. If the arbitrator certifies the recall of a member of the board, the recall shall be effective upon mailing of the final order of arbitration to the association. If the association fails to comply with the order of the arbitrator, the division may take action under s. [723.006](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.006). A member so recalled shall deliver to the board any and all records and property of the association in the memberâs possession within 5 full business days after the effective date of the recall.

4.âIf the board fails to duly notice and hold a board meeting within 5 full business days after service of an agreement in writing or within 5 full business days after the adjournment of the membersâ recall meeting, the recall shall be deemed effective and the board members so recalled shall immediately turn over to the board all records and property of the association.

5.âIf the board fails to duly notice and hold the required meeting or fails to file the required petition, the memberâs representative may file a petition pursuant to s. [723.1255](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/723.1255) challenging the boardâs failure to act. The petition must be filed within 60 days after expiration of the applicable 5-full-business-day period.

However, the association is not liable for an erroneous disclosure of the e-mail address or the number for receiving electronic transmission of notices.

(f)âAll of the associationâs insurance policies or copies thereof, which must be retained within this state for at least 5 years after the expiration date of the policy.

Personnel costs may not be charged for records requests that result in the copying of 25 or fewer pages. The association may charge up to 25 cents per page for copies made on the associationâs photocopier. If the association does not have a photocopy machine available where the records are kept, or if the records requested to be copied exceed 25 pages in length, the association may have copies made by an outside duplicating service and may charge the actual cost of copying, as supported by the vendor invoice.

2.âE-mail addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, emergency contact information, any addresses for a home owner other than as provided for association notice requirements, and other personal identifying information of any person, excluding the personâs name, lot designation, mailing address, and property address. Notwithstanding the restrictions in this subparagraph, an association may print and distribute to home owners a directory containing the name, park address, and telephone number of each home owner. However, a home owner may exclude his or her telephone number from the directory by so requesting in writing to the association. The association is not liable for the disclosure of information that is protected under this subparagraph if the information is included in an official record of the association and is voluntarily provided by a home owner and not requested by the association.

Nothing in this subsection affects the rights of ingress or egress of any member of the association.

(10)âAny mobile home ownersâ association or group of residents of a mobile home park as defined in this chapter may conduct bingo games as provided in s. [849.0931](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/849.0931).

(11)âAn association organized under this chapter may offer subscriptions, for the purpose of raising the necessary funds to purchase, acquire, and operate the mobile home park, to its members or other owners of mobile homes within the park. Subscription funds collected for the purpose of purchasing the park shall be placed in an association or other escrow account prior to purchase, which funds shall be held according to the terms of the subscription agreement. The directors shall maintain accounting records according to generally accepted accounting practices and shall, upon written request by a subscriber, furnish an accounting of the subscription fund escrow account within 60 days of the purchase of the park or the ending date as provided in the subscription agreement, whichever occurs first.

(12)âFor a period of 180 days after the date of a purchase of a mobile home park by the association, the association shall not be required to comply with the provisions of part V of chapter 718, part V of chapter 719, or part II of chapter 720, as to mobile home owners or persons who have executed contracts to purchase mobile homes in the park.

723.084âStorage charges on mobile homes.â

(1)âAs provided by this section, any lien or charge against a mobile home for storage upon the real property on which the mobile home is or has been located is subordinate to the rights of a lienholder for unpaid purchase price or first lien, which is recorded on the title of the mobile home, and the assignee of such lienholder if not recorded on the title. However, storage charges, as provided in this section, may be collected by the real property owner from the lienholder and the assignee of such lienholder by an action at law as authorized by this act. The term âlienholderâ as used in this act applies only to the lienholder for unpaid purchase price or first lien who has recorded said lien on the title of the mobile home.

(2)âThe real property owner shall be entitled to collect storage charges accruing from 5 days after the lienholder receives written notice of either an eviction proceeding instituted by the real property owner against the homeowner, or that the mobile home is abandoned or voluntarily surrendered by the homeowner. The notice shall state that an action for eviction has been filed against the homeowner, the amount of the daily storage charges calculated pursuant to this section, and the date upon which the homeowner is required to make regular payments to the property owner.

(3)âThe lienholder must notify the property owner within 30 days of receipt of the notice pursuant to subsection (2) whether it intends to make payment of the storage charges and, if the lienholder agrees to make payment, to pay the storage charges accruing to that date. Thereafter, the lienholder shall pay storage charges according to the schedule of payments that the homeowner was responsible for paying. In the event that the lienholder does not notify the property owner of its intention to not pay storage charges, the storage charges shall accrue and be due and owing to the property owner. In the event the lienholder notifies the property owner within 30 days of the receipt of the notice that it does not intend to pay the storage charges, the storage charges shall not accrue, but the lienholder shall not be entitled to any of the protections set forth in this act, and shall be subject to any remedies available to the property owner including retention of possession of the mobile home and foreclosure thereon to satisfy the landlordâs lien for rent.

(4)âIn the event that the lienholder files either an action for replevin of the home or forecloses on the lien for unpaid purchase price or first lien, the lienholder is responsible for storage charges accrued from 30 days after the date of filing of the action for replevin or foreclosure.

(5)âIn the event that the homeowner declares bankruptcy, the lienholder is responsible for storage charges accrued from and after 5 days after the final court action discharging the bankruptcy, or releasing the collateral, whichever occurs first.

(6)âThe maximum storage charge available to the real property owner is a daily rate equal to one-thirtieth of the amount of the monthly payment last paid by the homeowner, the then-current lot rental amount paid by the homeowner, or if no payment has been made, the payment required pursuant to contract between the real property owner and the homeowner. The maximum daily storage charges may be increased over time in accordance with the notice requirements under applicable provisions of Florida law, including, but not limited to, this chapter.

(7)âNotice required as set forth in subsection (2) shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested. Notice by certified mail shall be effective on the date of receipt or, if refused, on the date of refusal. All other notices may be by regular mail, and will, for purposes of calculation of time, be considered delivered 5 days after the date postmarked.

(8)âFor any lien for unpaid purchase price or first lien recorded after April 8, 1992, the lienholder shall notify the property owner of the lien against the mobile home and the address of the lienholder.

(9)âIt shall be unlawful for the property owner to refuse to allow the lienholder to repossess and move the mobile home for failure to pay any charges which were not noticed in accordance with the requirements of this section. In the event that the real property owner refuses to allow the lienholder to repossess and move the mobile home, then the real property owner shall be liable to the lienholder for each day that the real property owner unlawfully maintains possession of the home, at a daily rate equal to one-thirtieth of the monthly payment last paid by the homeowner to the real property owner, or, if no payment has been made, the payment required pursuant to contract between the real property owner and the homeowner.
